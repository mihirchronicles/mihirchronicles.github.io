First, why investing? I was raised by a single mother. And when we were in the thick of barely having anything, investing was my way out. I set out to invest my teenage earnings in stocks to be self-sufficient and help my mom with bills. Besides that, there is no better way to learn about the real world than throwing myself out there. I purchased my first stock at the age of 17, which happened to be right before the 2008 recession. In a few months, I lost all my savings that I accumulated from my summer jobs. The pain from losing a huge sum of money at young age was tough to swallow, but I learned several lessons early on in my life. It shaped my choices and way of thinking. This is when understanding the psychology of markets and business became fascinating to me. In the end, markets are people. If we understand markets, we understand people, and vice-versa.
