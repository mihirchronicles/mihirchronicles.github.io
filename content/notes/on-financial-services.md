I have spent one-third of my life in financial services sector. The financial service is a broad sector of the economy made up of companies and institutions that provide a wide range of money management, wealth management, portfolio advice and products, and financial intermediation services to individuals investors, institutional investors, businesses, and governments. 

I have worked for two major investment firms — Morningstar and Charles Schwab which either help with facilitating buying and selling of securities, managing investment portfolios, and/or offering financial advice.

This is my notepad of everything I have learned and learning over time.

| _Donor Advised Funds_ | A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) is a charitable giving account established at a public charity, known as the sponsoring organization, which manages and administers the fund on behalf of the donor. When you contribute cash, securities, or other assets to a DAF, you are generally eligible for an immediate tax deduction. The assets in the DAF can then be invested for tax-free growth, and you can recommend grants from your fund to any eligible IRS-qualified public charity at any time. |
