## I. Brief Summary

A book about Charlie Munger. The originality lacks because it is a collection of Munger quotes. Tren Griffin argues his ideas aren't well understood because they aren't unified. This book attempts to do unify Munger's big ideas, so one can learn to think well like Charlie Munger.

## II. Big Ideas

- Munger’s ability to cut to the heart of an issue with a few well-chosen words is legendary, as is his desire to think independently.
- Attain “ataraxia or perfect imperturbability” meaning becoming unshakeably calm and collected.
- Graham value investing principles
    - The critical point of Graham’s system is that it is simple.
    - If you cannot accept investing underperformance in the short term to achieve a long term investment outperformance, you are not a candidate for graham value investing.
    - Very often the shortcut to being smart, is to simply not be stupid.
    - Knowing what you don’t know is more useful that being brilliant.
    - If you do not understand the actual business of the company, you cannot understand the value of assets related to that business.
    - Be motivated when you’re buying and selling securities by reference to intrinsic value instead of price momentum.
    - When stocks are a bargain, people are fearful; when stocks are expensive, people are greedy.
    - Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.
    - If you are an investor, your focus is on what the asset is going to do, if you are a speculator, you are focusing on what the price is going to do.
    - A mine is a hole in the ground, owned by a liar.
    - The best way to determine the value of a business is based on the price a private investor would pay for the entire business.
    - An investment objective to beat inflation by 10% is a good one.
    - Munger doesn’t invest in gold because it is not an income producing asset. Gold has speculative value and commercial value, but not calculable intrinsic value.
    - The idea of margin of safety, will never become obsolete. Margins of safety are achieved when stocks are purchased at prices that can accommodate for human error, bad luck or extreme volatility. In engineering, people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial world, people don’t give a damn about safety. They just let it balloon and balloon and balloon.
    - Mr. Markets bipolar nature is the biggest gift to Graham investors. Occasionally he will present you with great bargains, at other times he will buy your assets at a huge premium. Do not treat him as a wise man, instead use him as your servant. If you are the crowd, then you cannot, by definition, beat the crowd. The idea of being objective and dispassionate, will never be obsolete.
- Worldly wisdom
    - You must know big ideas in the big disciplines, and use them routinely – all of them and not just a few.
    - You can’t remember isolated facts and try to bang them back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form.
    - The nature of human psychology is that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models.
    - There are factors that are terribly important, but there is no precise numbering you can put to these factors. People overweigh the stuff that can be numbered. This is a mistake that has to be avoided.
    - People calculate too much and think too little.
    - People who cannot be alone with their own thoughts are terrible candidates to become successful value investors.
    - Man’s imperfect, limited brain easily drifts into working with what is easily available to it.
    - People who are not the smartest, not even the most diligent can continuously rise in life if they are learning machines.
    - Own businesses, that given your experience and education are easy to understand.
    - If you cannot explain why you failed after you made a mistake, the business was too complex for you.
- Psychology of human misjudgement 
    - (Possibility of Gain * Amount of Gain) – (Possibility of Loss* Amount of Loss). This is an imperfect equation, but one with fantastic insights.
    - The rule of nature is that you get what you reward for. If you want ants to come, put some sugar on the floor.
    - It is very hard to convince a man to believe non-X, when his way of making a living requires him to believe X.
    - Loaning money to friends and relatives is fraught with danger. It is usually a better idea to give away money and not expect it back.
    - A year in which you don’t change your mind on some big idea that is important to you is a wasted year.
    - Avoid evil, particularly if they are attractive and members of the opposite sex.
    Life is too short to do business with people you don’t like.
    - It is counterproductive for a prey that is threatened by predator to take a long time in deciding what to do.
    - I was born innately curious. It that doesn't work for you, figure out your own damn system.
    - Tolerating a little unfairness to some to get a greater fairness to all is a model that I recommend.
    - Envy is really stupid because it is the one you could never possibly have any fun at. There is a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on to that trolley?
    - Someone will always be getting richer faster than you. This is not a tragedy.
    - It is not greed that drives the world. It is envy.
    - One should recognize reality, even when one does not like it.
    - Failure to handle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke.
    - What a man wishes, he will believe.
    - We all feel losses 2.5x more than we feel gains.
    - Good ideas tend to cause more mischief than bad ideas. It is so easy for all of us to really push up a good idea to wretched excess.
    - All skills attenuate with disuse.
    - Three things can ruin people: drugs, liquor and leverage.
    - Addiction can happen to any of us, through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.
    - Why play dice with something that can ruin your life forever ?
    - Only seek bets with a huge upside and a limited downside.(positively optionality). Just ignore the ones with huge downsides and limited upsides.(negative optionality).
    - I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don’t have any real knowledge.

## III. Quotes

- Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day.

- Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets—and can be lost in a heartbeat.
- Envy is a really stupid sin because it’s the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There’s a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?
- Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance).
- Man’s imperfect, limited-capacity brain easily drifts into working with what’s easily available to it. And the brain can’t use what it can’t remember or when it’s blocked from recognizing because it’s heavily influenced by one or more psychological tendencies bearing strongly on it … the deep structure of the human mind requires that the way to full scope competency of virtually any kind is to learn it all to fluency—like it or not.
- Learning from the success and failure of others is the fastest way to get smarter and wiser without a lot of pain.
