The forcing function of momentum is urgency. Besides luck and things falling into place, action creates clarity. Action beats overthinking every time.

Why?

Shorter decision-to-execution cycles create tighter feedback loops. They expose what is real versus what is noise. Compressing a timeline from one quarter to one month creates signal. This is where momentum shows up.

Deliberation is required however on where you can compress a timeline. Sending humans to a celestial body requires deep analysis, but most tasks are not as mission-critical. Most of these less critical tasks allow you to start again by going through a revolving door. But there is no revolving door if you're an astronaut in a spaceship. Knowing the difference is crucial.

In 1983, Michael Bloomberg unveiled a desktop computer known as “the terminal” that would revolutionize financial markets. The keyboard, initially called the Chiclet, was toy-like. None of the yellow keys worked when it launched. The yellow keys were for major markets—commodities, equities, municipal debt, preferred stocks, mortgages, money markets, governments, corporates, and currencies. Initially, only government bonds worked. The rest of the features weren't completed for three to seven years.

There is a lesson in this beta story: don't be afraid to put things out there even if they are half-working. The Bloomberg terminal is a major success story today because Mike Bloomberg was comfortable letting go of perfectionism.

Action over delay is what drives real growth.

On the flip side, you cannot be pressured to run fast if your goals aren't clean and clear. Acceleration happens when you're aware of what you're chasing. False urgency leads to mistakes and unnecessary stress that deplete your energy. You don't want speed to turn into noise.
Urgency is a force multiplier when your goals are clean because it kills hesitation. Your team sees and feels momentum, your doubters turn into believers, and the micro-changes start to compound.

Momentum builds on momentum. Each quick win creates energy for the next one. It compounds into a competitive advantage.

Shrink your timelines and know what is urgent versus important. Not because everything will get done faster, but because the habit of moving fast will make you more successful than the people still waiting for the perfect moment. The perfect moment is a myth. The urgent moment is now.
