A question worth exploring—where do you find your magic? Here is my list:

1. Hiking in the mountains
2. Walking and biking on trails surrounded by trees and water
3. Long conversations with my wife and mom
4. Holding philosophical conversations with family and friends
5. Spending time with both my human and dog kid
6. Painting canvases and drawing silly things
7. Listening to Eminem and Ludovico Einaudi
8. Reading books
9. Exploring complex topics by writing about them
10. Meeting folks from random communities and learning about them
11. Organizing physical and digital things
12. Watching basketball
13. Dancing
14. Exploring artists and their work
15. Share my passion with others about Mungerism and Buffettology
16. Coffee shops
17. Fitness clubs
18. Book clubs

None of these go in particular order, but they give me the most energy when I do these things making life feel flawless. A reminder to do more of these, not less.
