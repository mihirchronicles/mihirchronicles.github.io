At times, workplace problems are already defined at a strategic level, requiring only execution. Other times, we must proactively explore problems to get them prioritized. In both instances, success relies on a clear problem statement and measurable outcomes.

The trap is rushing into “solution mode.” This must be resisted until thorough discovery is conducted. Problem exploration is messy, so where do you start?

Start with Curiosity. Discovery is key. 

The best product managers aren't the ones with all the answers; they are the ones who know which questions to ask. Questions, not frameworks, are the true superpower of a product manager. Real breakthroughs come from asking the hard questions and understanding the underlying dynamics.

To do this effectively, collect context from various groups. The broader and deeper your dimensions, the more nuances you will discover. Use the following dimensions to guide your discovery voyage:

- Target Audience: Who are the users? How are they segmented? What channels do we support?
- **User-Defined Problem: How do they describe what's wrong? What are they exploring to solve their problem? How do they describe value in their own words?
- Behavioral Analysis: What are the user habits? What incentives are driving their current behavior?
- Ecosystem Analysis (External): Who else is affected? What power dynamics (regulations, policies) keep the status quo in place?
- Organization Dynamics (Internal): What are our assumptions? What are the non-negotiables and resource constraints? Is this actually a process problem pretended to be a tech problem? Is there a messaging or user behavior issue?
- Product & Technology: What capability gaps does our product have? Is the solution feasible within the timeline? Is the existing solution usable? If a solution is outsourced, how is the organization going to operationalize the solution?
- Adoption & Distribution: How will we validate the solution? (Did they ask for a vitamin, but we built a painkiller?) How are we going to scale our solution and maximize our impact? How are we going to drive early adopters? How do we influence the naysayers?

Once you have cast a wide net with these questions, you will have a mountain of data. Now, you must synthesize that noise into a signal using the “define the business problem framework” below.

1. The Problem: Clearly state the problem itself, ensuring it is not masked as a potential solution.
2. Affected Parties: Who is directly and indirectly impacted?  
3. The True Impact: What are the tangible consequences? Be honest; is this a real business impact or just an annoyance?  
4. Defining Success: What specific value is delivered upon resolution? *Warning:* If your definition of success is “implementing X tech solution,” you have failed to define business value.

Let's put this framework in action.

- Weak Problem Statement: “We lack a CRM, which complicates call management for our Customer Service team. Therefore, we should implement Salesforce.”
    - *Critique:* This jumps directly to a solution (Salesforce) without quantifying the pain.
- Effective Problem Statement: “The Customer Service team spends 40% of their time searching for data across disconnected systems, delaying issue resolution and creating inconsistent customer experience.”
- Affected Parties: 15 CSRs (direct frustration), Customers (wait times), Sales Team (missed upsell context).  
- True Impact: Average handle time is 8 mins (vs. 5 min benchmark). Revenue impact estimated at $180K/year in lost productivity. CSR turnover up 25%.  
- Success Definition: CSRs access customer context within 10 seconds. Handle time reduced to 5 minutes. CSAT (satisfaction) scores improve to 4.0+.

Start with the problem first, solution last. Your product is flexible—you can build anything. But problems, channels, and business models are rigid constraints. Start there.

Great problem statements come from curiosity. The best problem statements have both depth and complexity.

As Seth Godin says—*It doesn't make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open. The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key.*
