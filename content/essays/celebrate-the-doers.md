I recently came across a post where the folks were being made fun of who built a wearable pin called Humane. 

My first reaction was why hate the doers. What did this person accomplish? The post flooded the comments with personal attack on their appearances. This is a cheap way to target other people's work. We shouldn't blast people for trying.

Instead, we should applaud bravery. It is not easy to build a product. The product might not have been perfect but they contributed towards the future of innovation. This is how iPhone was born. Technology is built upon the past foundations. Great concepts are borrowed from failed innovation. Version 1 is never perfect, but the future ones will be far superior.

Even one of the best thinkers, late Charlie Munger would not bet against the doers, and he knew a heck lot more about how the world operates. He knew Elon Musk overestimates himself but he was wise enough not to ever bet against him.

The world changes because of doers, not critics. Let's celebrate the doers for the bet they place on the future for what most think is impossible or hard.

I'd rather see the world building, failing and learning from it than being entertained for mockery.
