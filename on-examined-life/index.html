2016</p><hr/></header><section itemProp="articleBody"><p>Socrates was right about <em>an unexamined life is not worth living</em>.</p>
<p>Life often feels like a battlefield, filled with daily struggles and challenges. However, shifting your focus to what truly matters can bring clarity and purpose. Many life lessons may seem like clichés until they are personally experienced, but without a philosophical foundation, life can feel chaotic and directionless. Pursuing a life of quality and conviction is a worthwhile endeavor, and the key to achieving it lies in understanding your own belief system.</p>
<p>Stoicism, along with other philosophical frameworks, life experiences, and lessons learned from failures, serves as a powerful remedy for many of today’s modern problems. Below are my lessons. They are not rigid rules but rather guiding principles I use to hold myself accountable to a certain standard in life. They are presented in no particular order, but each holds significance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek excellence.</strong> It fills your soul. Be a yardstick of quality where excellence is expected.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't set rules, set values.</strong> Rules set limits that teach us to adopt a fixed view of the world. Values encourage us to internalize principles for ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Seek honesty in all matters.</strong> Without honesty none of the values below matter. It is easy to fool yourself subconsciously because your brain will allow you to play all sort of games and tricks. Once you give in to these tricks, breaking the honesty wall becomes a habit and lying becomes a norm. And yes, lying to yourself is not okay either! This is why honesty is the highest virtue you will carry. It takes years to build reputation and minutes to break trust. The byproduct of being honest is authenticity and originality because it leads you to a path that you want to take, not led by someone else. So always strive to seek for authenticity. If you are honest, you will own your individuality and the world will respect you for that. And if you ever screw up, actively seek out correction, accept ownership of your mistake and the world will forgive you. These are the traits of honest people.</li>
<li><strong>Be kind to yourself and everyone.</strong> Kindness has a longer shelf life and it cost nothing. Respect everything around you—yourself, people, work, time, money and relationships. Especially the “yourself” part. If you are kind to yourself (mind, body and soul), you can then learn to be kind to others and your environment around you. When you are kind to yourself the world fades out. Do not try to overburden yourself with acquaintances because it is very difficult to manage 100 long-term friendships versus 10 deeper ones. This is just one example of respecting relationships. You can respect others by giving them 3 things—being reliable, giving them 100% attention and making them feel good about themselves. You never know what others are going through. Be compassionate, respectful and never forget to smile.</li>
<li><strong>Dance with the universe.</strong> You are solely responsible for your own life. So design it however you want. You are writing a play as you are in it and acting it. You have this universe in front of you that you ignore it or dance with it. And if you learn to dance with the universe, you will build your own self-esteem and confidence.</li>
<li><strong>We all wake up with a fresh set of choices and how to respond to them.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. — Viktor E. Frankl</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We all can be masters at our craft, but you have to make a choice. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be. — Kobe Bryant</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a big believer in that we design our lives. We are writing a play as we are in it and acting it. You have this universe in front of you that you can ignore it or dance with it. — Tina Roth Eisenberg</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it. — Michael Jordan</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abundance mindset is better than scarcity mindset.</strong> Being a life-long learner is not enough. You need to teach and share with others. Teaching requires a mindset of abundance. It requires you to be an anti-hater and anti-envious. There are two sets of people—people who contribute and people who don't. People with abundant mindset believe there is plenty in the world for everyone and are always happy to see others succeed. People with scarcity mindset tend to hoard because they are worried someone is going to get ahead. The zero-sum mindset is pure evil in my opinion. It leads to envy and unhappiness. Just look in a country like Haiti, and you'll find a family living on $2/day is happy to share their meal with you as if they have enough to share. I've experienced this myself when I was there. They should have a scarcity mindset because of lack of resources, but it is the opposite, they welcome you with open hearts and willing to share with you the little they have. People with scarcity mindset are always unhappy because there is never enough. The joy lies in sharing with others.</li>
<li><strong>Live deliberately every day.</strong> How many of us settle into habits and simply live the same year over and over again, waiting for some future event to occur before we start living? While you wait for that raise or career opportunity or ideal relationship, you tend to forget that life is happening <em>now</em>. Living deliberately is about awareness and purposeful action. If you take the necessary steps to craft each day deliberately, when the final day arrives, you'll be able to look back at a life brimming with joy, fulfillment and satisfaction. Today is all matters! Today, jettison the dead weight that’s holding you down.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow isn't real. Life is just a bunch of todays. — Janis Joplin</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice equanimity by building pockets of stillness into your life.</strong> There is no such thing as being always happy. If you are sad, accept sadness. Accept every emotion to the fullest and ride them out with equanimous (calm and composed) mind. When the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands it as things are, then there is no suffering. Experience joy or sadness without giving into craving. Suffering comes from craving. You will maintain peace of mind with the attitude of accepting “as is” when you are dealing with emotions. Both peak and bottom shall pass by. This is one way to show gratitude.</li>
<li><strong>Positivity is a good behavior.</strong> Asking a question positively generates a better response. Example: “'Person: Can I smoke while I'm praying?' Priest: No. 'Person: Can I pray whilst I'm smoking?' Priest: Of course you can.” Positive thinking is an incredibly powerful tool. Proactive behavior spurs positivity and vice-versa. The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. Positive people don't just have a good day; they make it a good day. People who think positively usually see endless possibilities. Success doesn't create optimism, but optimism leads to progress. Avoid negative energy at all cost. But do not drop your skepticism. A skeptic is not a pessimist. A skeptic just knows how to avoid stupidity while being an optimist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be discriminating about what images and ideas you permit into your mind. — Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any person capable of angering you becomes your master. — Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. — Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek truth.</strong> Seek truth by always going to the source. Always ask why! Rationalize from the first-principles thinking. Ideas need to be mapped to objective reality to draw facts. The mindset of optimistic contrarian is when you think clearly from the ground up. Tactics provide the “what” and the “how.” But if you want results no matter how the landscape changes, you must also understand the “why.” By understanding the principles that shape your reality, your “why” will more accurately guide your thoughts and actions. Invert everything to refine your thinking. Instead of worrying about what it takes to be successful, ask yourself what will it take to be not successful. Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy. Inversion allows you to remove blind-spots from your initial hypothesis. Believe in yourself but self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion. Learn to think well, and it'll pay huge reward!</li>

<p>The role of the artist is to be a mirror, to reflect back to our culture, to help us think critically and inspire action. — Hannah Chalew</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him. We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth. — JFK</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If something isn’t working, listen. Action without understanding is the beginning of destruction.  — Victor Saad</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live frugal, but not cheap.</strong> Learn to avoid lifestyle inflation and shifting up your goal post. Consume to meet the basic needs, waste nothing and be content with what you have. But don’t make mistake frugality with letting go of your youth and having fun. You don't have to cheap out on having fun. Both fun and frugality can co-exist. People who live far below their means enjoy freedom that people who are busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom. Frugality allows you to stay rich. Getting rich and staying rich are different things that require different skills. Spending money to show off is the fastest way to lose money. Debt will cripple you. Savings will give you wings to fly on. Freedom plus time are worth much more than nice cars and clothes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth consists not in having many possessions, but in having few wants. — Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves too much, who is poor. — Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can’t pursue anything if you’re pursuing everything.</strong> Focus is a force multiplier both in work and life. Without intense focus everything else fails. And focusing on too many things is a recipe for failure. Cultivate trust and attention. Protect your attention like you protect your friends, family, and money. Singular focus allows you to choose direction over speed. If you don't know the direction, it doesn't matter how fast you are traveling. Inversely, if you’re locked on to your desired destination, all progress is positive, no matter how slow you’re going. Of all emotions, desire must be controlled most, as it shapes what we pursue and defines our destiny. You’ll reach your destination eventually with intense focus and ruthlessly prioritizing.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Courage leads to action and learn from failure.</strong> Courage (risk-taking) is the highest virtue. Courage requires taking the first step. The journey of discovery is often tedious, filled with dead ends, and above all random, but persistence through randomness will always prevail. Grit comes from learning which allows you to get back up after you get knocked down. The issue with bravery is not many want to be pointed at for failure. But courage fundamentally requires accepting failure. You can learn more from your failure than success. Why? Because it is hard for most people to be humble. There are these defenses, overlooking their flaws and limitations. When it comes to human endeavor, success carries within itself with the seeds of failure and failure carries with the seeds of success. What do you learn from success? I can do it. I can do it again. It’s easy. I can do it in other fields. I can do it with more money. I can do it alone. It was me. It wasn’t a team. These are horrible lessons, success teaches terrible lessons because it plays our to your ego. You learn more from failures which allows you to learn humility. Enduring pain will help you take larger challenges and help you grow. Larger the ambition or creativity, larger the requirement of not asking for permission. No one will show up at your door and lift you up. You have to go out their and show the world what you are capable of. This requires courage!</li>

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. — Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<li><strong>Be a lifelong student.</strong> To become a lifelong learner you have to prevent two biggest barriers—ego and blindspot. Be radically open-minded. Your need to be right and having strong opinions will prevent you from learning less and falling short of your potential. Everyone perceives reality differently which puts blindspot barriers. Using multidisciplinary approach and working with insightful and diverse people will narrow down your blindspots. Knowing too much is “the curse of knowledge” which is the inability to realize that other people with less experience than you have don’t see the world through the same lens you do. Hold thoughtful opinions loosely! Don't be married to an idea or be part of a cult. Update your knowledge as you progress in life. Always carry humility with you while being a life-long student.</li>

Compound interest is the most underrated law. Extreme patience with extreme focus with extreme decisiveness with a long-term view will do magic and wonders. It’s amazing how much of a competitive advantage can be found by simply having the disposition to wait longer than everyone else. Be the tortoise, not the hare!

<li><strong>Repetition leads to excellence.</strong> Consistency is the playground for perfection. Be so good that they can't ignore you. Key to becoming so good is to do boring tasks over and over again until you perfect it. Doing new and cool things is desirable but doing repetitive task is not. It will take many tries till you perfect your art. Use space repetition technique and focused/diffused mode. Effort counts not passion; effort counts not talent. Deliberate practice is a key to repetition. Structured but flexible repetition is the best productivity tool. It doesn't matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results. The ability to show up every day, stick to the schedule, and do the work, especially when you don't feel like it, is so valuable that it is literally all you need to become better 99% of the time.

You can get to about 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and are willing to work a lot. You don't need to sacrifice life and hobbies while working hard. This is easy for people who see work playful. Momentum compounds, and hard work begets progress. Don't be afraid of it.</li>

<li><strong>Seek multidisciplinary approach over specialization.</strong> Complexity is the name of the game. We simplify because we are addicted to narratives, but the complexity goes on. This is why having a generalist mindset can be a huge advantage. Ideas in isolation doesn't have much value, but when you connect constellation of ideas, it takes a meaningful form. Knowing the key drivers and major ideas in variety of fields is a huge source of leverage. It is difficult to study broadly and deeply, but the two aren't mutually exclusive. You have to be radically open-minded. It is easy to pay homage to Charlie Munger’s latticework of mental models, but when you live it, you see why he is right.</li>

<li><strong>Luck increases with surface area.</strong> Be in the right places, have lots of conversations, put yourself out there, ask for what you want and be optimistic and positive.</li>

<li><strong>Guard your energy and time</strong>.  In order to preserve the most of your time, you need to avoid distractions. The biggest class of distraction is the things you can’t control. By focusing on what you can’t control, you lose control. Blindspots abound. To find lasting peace in an unpredictable world, you have but one option — control over your character. The Stoics likened life to an archer — she controls her aim and shot but not the wind that may alter the arrow’s path. Thus, her focus should be on perfecting her aim, not the outcome.</li>

<li><strong>Hard work and play are indistinguishable.</strong> You will see this in so called successful people. They are serious about the game they play. This is also true for children. They are pretty intense because they are serious when they play. This is where childlike wonder comes from.</li>
<li><strong>The challenge in life is figuring out both which game to play and how to play it best.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The way to get things done is to be small and move fast.</strong> Moving fast forces you to strip things down to the bare bones. Impose urgency. Yes, no one is dying, but the missions drive humanity forward. Small is less complex. 2 is better than 4. 4 is better than 8. This is the nature of power laws.</li>
<li><strong>20s are for explorations. 30s are for execution.</strong> Don't waste it.</li>
<li><strong>Find people who energize you and make you want to conquer the world.</strong> Go be friends with them. Long-term friends multiply life's true wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Proximity rules in relationships.</strong> Almost all relationships require proximity and intention to keep growing. True connection flourishes when we prioritize being present and intentional with one another. There are exceptions, but they are much rarer than you think.</li>
<li><strong>The energy you put out in the world, you get back.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Beware of over-delegation and being too far from the details.</strong> I see too many people avoid real work. The work is in the details. The deeper you go, the better it gets.</li>
<li><strong>To enrich your professional life you have to be both strategic and detail-oriented.</strong> Ideas alone aren't enough and being in the trenches blocks you seeing the horizon. Competitive edge lies when you can balance the two well.</li>
<li><strong>Doom scrolling and reading too much drowns out your inner voice.</strong> Lean more towards action.</li>
<li><strong>Days with 0 output are the killers</strong> and it matters when you know your primary focus but watch out for workaholic behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Imposter comes from over consuming.</strong> You need to balance your production and consumption balance.</li>
<li><strong>Learning happens when both context and time are right.</strong> Personal finance should be taught in high shcool is frequently discussed but if young adults don't have comprehension for the topic, what good will it do?</li>
<li><strong>Take the leap if you are thinking about it.</strong> Now is the time.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct annual reflection</strong> on everything that matters.</li>
<li><strong>Status seeking activities will eventually burn you out.</strong> Focus on substance and enduring value creation.</li>
<li><strong>Slowing down feels natural as you get older.</strong> Shift your priorities, lean into changes, be curious about new things, maintain child like wonder and move a lot. This should help prevent from slowing down.</li>
<li><strong>High agents don't ask for approvals and permissions.</strong> Figure out what you want to do, and plant the “this is happening” flag. People will come along for the ride.</li>

<p><strong>Most meaningful things in life are rooted in paradox.</strong> They often require us to embrace opposing truths, ideas, or emotions simultaneously. Rather than choosing one side or rejecting the other, we are invited to hold both perspectives at once—to allow them to coexist within us. This can feel uncomfortable, even chaotic, but it is in this tension that growth and understanding emerge. Sit with the contradictions, lean into the complexity, and resist the urge to tidy it up. Life is not meant to be neat or perfectly resolved; it is a beautiful, messy tapestry of opposites interwoven together. Find joy in the messiness, for it is here that life reveals its richness and depth.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Lower the resistance to the things you want to do. Inertia is a powerful thing. Use it to your advantage.</strong> Want to exercise for 30 minutes? Tell yourself you'll do it for 10 minutes. Then, at the 10-minute mark, decide if you want to keep going. Chances are you will. This also works for the opposite. Trying to eliminate a habit? Make it harder. Put as many obstacles and distance as you can. It works wonders to eliminate habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A disagreement does not mean a fight. Most disagreements stem from a lack of information.</strong> Learn conflict management as early as possible if you want people to be your greats allies in destroying the problems. In conflict management, never say “you”, but use “we” as often as you can to avoid finger pointing and blame game. Make “You vs Them” into “Us vs Them.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't forget to compliment people and say nice things to them.</strong> It doesn't matter whether it is a CEO or a janitor. We are all human beings, and we all want to live in a kinder environment. Offer a drink, snack or meal to contractors who come work at your house. Say hi to a janitor who cleans your desk. Be nice to your flight attendant. Treat the care takers of the world as best you can. Being good to strangers is the kindest thing you can do. This is how you build empathy for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You'd be surprised what people will do for you if you just ask.</strong> As the saying goes, “you won't get what you don't ask for.” Knowing the right people and competency will help you get where you want to go. It is not one or the other. It's the combination of both. Who do you know? How do you demonstrate competence? Are you competent? Making friends along the way and show your work. Being visible is equally important as doing the work if you want to get somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not having kids puts life on an easy mode and a life without purpose.</strong> They are not replacement for friends or being your future care takers. Life becomes much more fruitful if you can have them. You get a sense of pride and purpose.</p>

<li><strong>You cannot be a perfect version at all times.</strong> You are going to trip and fall when you encounter unexplored territory. Get up, show up, and keep learning. And don't judge others when they are in similar situations.</li>
<li><strong>Joy is not a reward system. It is a practice.</strong> You can have fun at all times without feeling guilty. You don't need to choose joy for special occasions only. No one will complain about a joyful person.</li>
<li><strong>Take ownership of your time, or watch others claim it for their purposes. The difference between intentional living and lost years often comes down to this single choice.</strong> Be intentional about letting others hijack your schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Most mess stems from wanting pursuing excess beyond necessity.</strong> Having more or doing more is not going to solve your mess.</li>
<li><strong>The in-between is where the magic happens.</strong> Use breaks, long walk, and nature to find harmony and balance. This is where you will unleash your creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity comes from space not from doing more.</strong> Being busy isn’t the same as being valuable. Learn the difference and take a step back when you feel overwhelmed.</li>

<li><strong>Some things are beautiful because they are small. Not everything needs to scale.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every moment begins with a story.</strong> What stories are shaping your choices right now? And who benefits from them? We live inside inherited narratives about growth, success, productivity, power—and often forget that these are not truths. They are agreements. Sometimes outdated ones. The good thing about stories is you can re-write them. Changemakers use stories to their own advantage.</li>
<li><strong>You need a clear sense of purpose to have a service orientation.</strong> Innovation for the sake of innovation isn't enough. Breaking things for the sake of breaking is not useful. Moving on quickly leaves the world disjointed. Understanding your place in the world is at the heart of moving the society forward. Understanding your foundational values is the fuel for conviction, vision and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Those who spend time on meticulous tasks are not wasting their time. It is spiritual to them.</strong> This comes from a place of love and care.</li>
<li><strong>No one complains about joy unless you are a Grinch. Even the Grinch likes to smile big.</strong> A place where humor is not appreciated is a place without a soul.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot quantify design, creativity or delight.</strong> People generally agree 10 is a bigger number than 5. But when it comes to beauty, it is labeled as an opinion. There is no formula for beauty. You cannot measure beauty. But a theater that delights a user for 2 hours is lot more welcoming than a theater with sloppy chairs. It is worth trying to create joyful and delightful experiences even though you cannot measure it. If it is delightful, it will be used more which is a positive thing in a transactional environment such as business.</li>
<li><strong>We go through chapters or seasons and the painful part the conclusion of one and beginning of the next.</strong> This forces you to change your perspective and approach. One should accept the constant state of flux but not at the expense of compromising your foundational values.</li>
<li><strong>The evolution of an idea always start with a thought.</strong> These thoughts come from a quiet place. Therefore, you should seek more silence. Listen more. Talk less. You never know what you might come across or miss out on if you are constantly speaking.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to design a better world then step out of the conference room.</strong> There is far more to learn from getting out on the field and talking to people.</li>
<li><strong>Beauty cannot exist without utility.</strong> If something is not useful then it is ugly no matter how attractive the aesthetics are. This is what it means when people say a great design has both form and function.</li>
<li><strong>Always choose a path that is more humane when you are presented with choices.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Poor consequences are a result of discussions happening far too late.</strong> If your intentions are blindsided with wrong incentives you are bound to have unexpected consequences which can be harmful to society.</li>
<li><strong>Pay a great deal of attention to the words you use because they affect the way we think.</strong> The words you choose to frame a problem has a lot more weight than you might think.</li>
<li><strong>Know your non-negotiables.</strong> Especially while you are parenting. The peak career years collide with your peak life years. Your kids are little, parents are aging, and your youth is slipping by. Your body and mental health is asking you to slow you down. Grind and sacrifice start to blur. You fight so hard to climb the ladder, and then realize the cost of staying there may be more than you are willing to pay. You have to decide what is worth it and what isn't. If you don't balance, if you are not asking the right questions, or if you are not setting the boundaries then one day you will end up with regrets. To minimize your regrets, know your trade-offs and set your non-negotiables, so you can truly live your life.</li>
<li>Lack of father figure taught me to gift time, not things. Becoming a father taught me to never mess this up.</li>
