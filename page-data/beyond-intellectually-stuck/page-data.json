While intellectual ideas are crucial, they can also lead to a feeling of stagnation because crucial details are overlooked.</p>\n<p>Humans use simplified models to comprehend the world, but these models inevitably omit numerous details. As the saying goes — <em>the map is not the territory.</em> Every step of the process is filled with intricate details that have tangible consequences for the outcome. Ignoring these details is simply not an option in this hyper-competitive era.</p>\n<p>Consider making a pour-over coffee. On the surface, it seems quite simple: two spoons of ground beans in a filter, followed by the pouring of boiling water, which results in a cup of delicious coffee.</p>\n<p>When you attempt to follow this recipe, you discover layers of complexity that weren’t apparent initially.</p>\n<p>First, you heat water. And baristas would tell you that the temperature is crucial. The ideal temperature varies depending on the type of coffee beans. For a dark roast, a higher temperature on the upper end can burn the beans and make the coffee taste bitter because higher temperatures increase the extraction speed. The same principle applies to medium and light roasts. The roast level of your coffee beans significantly impacts the flavor profile and extraction characteristics during pour-over brewing.</p>\n<p>Before heating your water, it’s crucial to have a general understanding of the type of coffee beans you are using. Not only the coffee type, but also the grind size plays a significant role in the brewing process. The ideal grind size for a pour-over coffee is a medium-coarse grind. Using an ultra-fine or fine grind size can result in a chalky taste.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve chosen the appropriate grind size, you need to consider the type of filter. Pour-over coffee requires specialized filters, such as cone filters or flat-bottomed ones, to accommodate the larger surface areas of the dripper. Additionally, you should factor in the choice between bleached and unbleached filters.</p>\n<p>Choosing the filter dripper is next. Deciding between a glass filter and a metal filter will determine the acidity of your coffee.</p>\n<p>The ratio of coffee to water is another important factor. A general guideline is 1:16, which means 1 gram of coffee for every 16 grams of water. However, this is just a starting point and not a strict rule. The actual measurement depends on how much of your hot water can extract flavor from the coffee beans.</p>\n<p>I brew my coffee daily using a pour-over method, but I initially underestimated the intricate details involved. If someone had shared these numerous details while I was starting out, I doubt I would have continued my morning routine. However, in the process, I realized that elegant ideas do not imply simplicity.</p>\n<p>The subtle nuances of reality hold significant importance in determining the final outcome, which our models, perceptions, or recipes fail to capture. In hindsight, everything becomes evident, but the unsung heroes of success lie in the intricate details. This is why details make all the difference in the world. The small aspects collectively contribute to substantial outcomes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Beyond Intellectually Stuck","date":"April 19, 2025","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-artificial-intelligence/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Artificial Intelligence"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-splendid-exchange/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Splendid Exchange | How Trade Shaped The World by William J.
