Forests, thermostat, oceans, economy, internet, and even our galaxy. There are also countless subsystems, for example, a business or a human body. You can break these even further which will result in subsystems of a subsystem.</p>\n<p>In engineering, it is the ability to debug, understand feedback loops, and understanding what a good measurement is.</p>\n<p>In business, it is the ability to design drive-thru, so customers can purchase goods and services faster and business can maximize efficiency per unit of resource it employs.</p>\n<p>In forests, it is the ability to maximize photosynthesis when there is no sun for days.</p>\n<p>Or think of a thermostat when it is operating during harsh winters. If a thermostat is constantly fighting to reach equilibrium because the inflow of cold air from outside is higher than the outflow of hot air from HVAC system, it will reach a breaking point.</p>\n<p>Everything is a system. The ability to design a complex system and how it interacts with other system is critical to understand. If you can understand the system you operate within, you will know how to drive possible solutions.</p>\n<p>Learning to be a system thinker is highly advantageous.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A system is better than a single element and that good design is the overall configuration of a product. — Dieter Rams</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The source of all our problems today comes from the gap between how we think and now nature works. — Dee Hock</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life is not about control. It’s not about getting. It’s not about having. It’s not about knowing. It’s not even about being. Life is eternal, perpetual becoming, or it is nothing. Becoming is not a thing to be known, commanded, or controlled. It is a magnificent, mysterious odyssey to be experienced. — Dee Hock</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them! — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we’re to understand anything, we have to simplify, which means we have to make boundaries. — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.” — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion. — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone. — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and chaotic. It is dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, not uniformity. That's what makes the world interesting, that's what makes it beautiful, and that's what makes it work. — Donella H. Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An adaptive agent is constantly playing a game with its environment. What exactly does that mean? Distilled to the essence, what actually has to happen for game-playing agents to survive and prosper? Two things, Holland decided: prediction and feedback. — M. Mitchell Waldrop</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All these complex systems have somehow acquired the ability to bring order and chaos into a special kind of balance. This balance point—often called the edge of chaos—is were the components of a system never quite lock into place, and yet never quite dissolve into turbulence, either. — M. Mitchell Waldrop</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"system-overview\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#system-overview\" aria-label=\"system overview permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>System overview</h2>\n<p>A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.</p>\n<p>A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.</p>\n<p>A system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose.</p>\n<p>A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.</p>\n<p>A system is composed of stocks (quantities measured at a specific moment in time) and flows (change over time)\nA complex system is more than just the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Feedback loops are where changes in stock affects the flow in/out of the same stock. There can be “balancing” feedback loops that have a regulatory, stabilizing behavior, and “re-enforcing” feedback loops that snowballs into an avalanche in the direction of change (positive or negative).</p>\n<p>A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity.</p>\n<p>Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow. A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. Changes in stocks set the pace of the dynamics of systems. Time lags that come from slowly changing stocks can cause problems in systems, but they also can be sources of stability. The presence of stocks allows inflows and outflows to be independent of each other and temporarily out of balance with each other.</p>\n<p>Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"characteristics-of-a-system\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#characteristics-of-a-system\" aria-label=\"characteristics of a system permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Characteristics of a system</h2>\n<p>The following are the key characteristics of a system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resilience: is a major determining factor in a system’s ability to adapt to changing conditions because it is a system’s elasticity, or how well it recovers from a transition. The resilience of any given system is a product of its structure as well as its feedbacks.</li>\n<li>Self-organization: some can also self-organize. That means they can learn, diversify, evolve and build on their own structure.</li>\n<li>Hierarchy: reduce the level of information any given part of the system has to handle.

If a flow stabilizes the difference between the actual and desired levels of stock then it’s known as balancing feedback. There is another kind of feedback loop which is known as reinforcing feedback, which generates more or less of what already exists.</p>\n<p>In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.</p>\n<p>The balancing feedback loop that should keep the system state at an acceptable level is overwhelmed by a reinforcing feedback loop heading downhill. The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state. The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken. The less corrective action, the lower the system state. If this loop is allowed to run unchecked, it can lead to a continuous degradation in the system’s performance.</p>\n<p>The more output that is produced, the more can be invested to make new capital. This is a reinforcing loop, like the birth loop for a population. The investment fraction is equivalent to the fertility. The greater the fraction of its output a society invests, the faster its capital stock will grow.</p>\n<p>Every balancing feedback loop has its breakdown point, where other loops pull the stock away from its goal more strongly than it can pull back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"system-malfunction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#system-malfunction\" aria-label=\"system malfunction permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>System malfunction</h2>\n<p>Most of what goes wrong in systems goes wrong because of biased, late, or missing information. Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper than rebuilding physical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same.</p>\n<p>All systems share common features, but some of them can produce extremely unnatural and even problematic behavior. This can happen when the individual subsystems each have a different goal, and it’s called policy resistance. If one actor within a system or any of its subsystems gets the upper hand and uses it to shift the system’s direction, all the others will have to work twice as hard to pull it back in line. The result is a system that looks stuck, reproducing the same problems over and over again. For instance, drug traffickers and addicts both want drug supplies to be high, but police want the opposite.</p>\n<p>Stop looking for who’s to blame; instead you’ll start asking, “What’s the system?” The concept of feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior.</p>\n<p>Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems—undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.</p>\n<p>Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nasa-on-systems-engineering\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#nasa-on-systems-engineering\" aria-label=\"nasa on systems engineering permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>NASA on systems engineering</h2>\n<p>Aerospace is one of the areas where precision is most needed. It is a combination of the most rigorous science and the most complex engineering. Its work, a spacecraft, must be precise enough to ensure the smooth completion of its mission.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, the National Aeronautics, and Space Administration (NASA) has been dedicated to the advancement of aeronautics and space science. The NASA The scientific and Technical Information (STI) program plays a key part in helping NASA maintain this important role. The handbook provides top-level guidelines for good systems engineering practices; it is not intended in any way to be a directive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Systems engineering is a methodical, disciplined approach for the design, realization, technical management, operations, and retirement of a system. A “system” is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.</li>\n<li>Systems engineering is the art and science of developing an operable system capable of meeting requirements within often opposed constraints. Systems engineering is a holistic, integrative discipline, wherein the contributions of structural engineers, electrical engineers, mechanism designers, power engineers, human factors engineers and many more disciplines are evaluated and balanced, one against another, to produce a coherent whole that is not dominated by the perspective of a single discipline.</li>\n<li>Systems engineering seeks a safe and balanced design in the face of opposing interests and multiple, sometimes conflicting constraints. The systems engineer must develop the skill and instinct for identifying and focusing Efforts on assessments to optimize the overall design and not favor one system/subsystem at the expense of another.</li>\n<li>There are three sets of common technical processes in NPR 7123.1, NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements: system design, product realization, and technical management.</li>\n<li>The systems engineer will usually play the key role in leading the development of the system architecture, defining and allocating requirements, evaluating design tradeoffs, balancing technical risk between systems, defining and assessing interfaces, providing oversight of verification and validation activities, as well as many other tasks.</li>\n<li>In summary, the systems engineer is skilled in the art and science of balancing organizational and technical interactions in complex systems.</li>\n<li>All other products in the system structure are realized by integration. Designers not only develop the design solutions to the products intended to perform the operational functions of the system but also establish requirements for the products and services that enable each operational/mission product in the system structure.</li>\n<li>The first is design. After the entire framework and top-level design are made, it is then realized by engineering methods; at the same time, management is also involved in the process of experimentation. Only in this way can it be ensured that the problems can be adjusted and corrected in time so that they can get back on track as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/3d22e/nasa_systems_engineering.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 79.11392405063292%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"NASA Systems Engineering\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/f058b/nasa_systems_engineering.png\" srcset=\"/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/c26ae/nasa_systems_engineering.png 158w,\n/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/6bdcf/nasa_systems_engineering.png 315w,\n/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/f058b/nasa_systems_engineering.png 630w,\n/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/40601/nasa_systems_engineering.png 945w,\n/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/78612/nasa_systems_engineering.png 1260w,\n/static/89a58291cae11a9e7727e775a272a87e/3d22e/nasa_systems_engineering.png 2010w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<h2 id=\"santa-fe-institute-sfi\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#santa-fe-institute-sfi\" aria-label=\"santa fe institute sfi permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Santa Fe Institute (SFI)</h2>\n<p>Santa Fe Institute is an influential interdisciplinary research institute. The main focus is on complex adaptive system.</p>\n<p>Complex adaptive system originated at Santa Fe Institute (SFI). Santa Fe Institute was formed in 1984. The SFI is an independent, nonprofit theoretical research institute dedicated to the study of complex adaptive systems.</p>\n<p>Complexity is the science of emergence where many individual agents interact and the outcomes are difficult to predict. A complex adaptive system is a system in which a large network of components with no central control exhibit complex behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptive learning.</p>\n<p>The theory of complexity manifests itself in “complex adaptive systems,” which are made up of many independent agents who interact and adapt to each other and to their environment, producing the phenomenon of emergence—a system behaving as more than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Adaptive agents play game with its environment for fitness. It is feedback driven. Hence, competition is much more essential than consistency. Competition and cooperation may seem antithetical but at some very deep level, they are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>Spontaneous self-organization can be found all over nature. It is the most powerful force in biology and living systems operate at the edge of chaos.

The crucial skill is insight. The ability to see connections.

Rocks are boulders which represent the most important priority like your family. Pebbles are least important but are critical to keep the lights on. Sand is insignificant which represents space filler with distraction. If you do the inverse, you run out of time for what matters.</p>\n<p>However, most teams misinterpret this lesson as purely a matter of size (e.g., Rocks = 3 months, Pebbles = 1 month). This misses the point. In the real world, these three categories require fundamentally different mindsets, metrics, and management styles.</p>\n<p>If you treat a “Rock” like a big “Pebble,” or manage “Sand” with the rigor of a “Rock,” you create a team that looks productive (high code output) but feels stuck (low strategic progress).</p>\n<p><strong>I. ROCKS—Maximizing Strategic Impact</strong>: Rocks are not just “long projects.” They are strategic initiatives intended to materially advance the company down a unique path, build durable advantages, or solve the most critical challenges.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration: 3–12 Months</li>\n<li>Core philosophy:\n<ul>\n<li>Maximize Impact, Not ROI: Do not choose Rocks based on efficiency. You are looking for dramatic results. If an idea is quick to build but offers only incremental improvement, it is not a Rock.</li>\n<li>Hofstadter’s Law: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.” A 3-month estimate is realistically a 3-to-12-month commitment.</li>\n<li>The “Greatness” Threshold: Because Rocks consume massive resources, “good” ideas are the enemy. You must hold out for “great” ideas. If you lack a truly strategic idea, do not invent busy work; focus on Pebbles until the strategy clarifies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to execute:\n<ul>\n<li>Deliberate Decisions: Unlike Agile development, Rock selection should be slow and deliberate. Once committed, treat it as a one-way door.</li>\n<li>Executive Ownership: While Product Managers (PMs) drive the definition, Executives must own the final decision to align it with the broader company strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>III. PEBBLES—Maximizing ROI</strong>: Pebbles are the “Goldilocks” of work. They are tactical wins—features that delight customers or counter competitors in the short term.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration: 1–4 Sprints</li>\n<li>Core philosophy:\n<ul>\n<li>Maximize ROI: Here, efficiency rules. We calculate ROI using the standard formula: ROI = Value/Effort</li>\n<li>The Estimation Trap: Be wary of the “Hofstadter” effect on ROI. If a project estimated at 4 weeks drags to 6, and the impact comes in 20% lower than expected, your ROI can drop by half.</li>\n<li>Scope Discipline: If a Pebble balloons beyond 4 sprints, it is becoming a Rock. You must either ruthlessly cut scope to fit the Pebble timeframe or pause and re-evaluate it as a strategic Rock.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to execute:\n<ul>\n<li>PM Sovereignty: The Product Manager is the ultimate decider for Pebbles. They sit at the intersection of customer needs, market pressure, and engineering reality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>III. SAND—Maximizing Throughput</strong>: Sand consists of the thousand small tweaks—bug fixes, UI polish, text changes, library upgrades—that cumulatively create quality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration: less than 1 Sprint (often hours)</li>\n<li>Core philosophy:\n<ul>\n<li>Maximize Throughput: Individual grains of sand are rarely measurable in isolation. Do not waste time trying to quantify the impact of fixing one bug. The goal is volume: how many small improvements can we ship?</li>\n<li>Kill Admin Overhead: The biggest enemy of Sand is process. If you spend 20 minutes creating a JIRA ticket for a 5-minute code fix, you have destroyed productivity.</li>\n<li>Emotional Prioritization: Because the business value of a single grain is negligible, prioritize based on energy. Let engineers fix the things that annoy them. Happy engineers produce better code.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to execute:\n<ul>\n<li>Self-Managed Teams: Management should not schedule Sand. If executives are prioritizing bug fixes, they are micromanaging. The team knows what needs to be polished; let them fit it in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IV. The Execution Algorithm</strong>: How do you fit this into a real Sprint Plan? Use this hierarchy of needs. If you cannot fit an item, cut from the bottom up.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Time-Critical Items: (Security patches, immovable launch dates).</li>\n<li>The Rock: Schedule enough stories to make visible progress. Never starve the Rock.</li>\n<li>The Pebble: Schedule stories for the current tactical win.</li>\n<li>Sand: Fill the gaps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/\">Rocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>S.P.A.D.E</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>Consensus doesn't work and when time comes to make hard decisions, there should be a person in-charge of it.

Brainstorm publicly.</li>\n<li>D is for Decide: Once you've laid out all the alternatives—complete with their respective pros and cons and quantitative modelーit is time to get your consultants to vote. Get feedback privately.</li>\n<li>E is for Explain: Once you've decided, now the real work begins. Go to the approver and lay out the alternatives and your argument.  If you created a high-quality decision framework, they're unlikely to veto it. Call a commitment meeting. Broadcast your decision. Add it to the S.P.A.D.E. log. Keep a log that links to your S.P.A.D.E. and marks the date of the decision.

OKR has been a better part of my professional journey, but the implementation of the methodology has always been messy because they do not cascade through the entire organization as they are intended to.</p>\n<p>This led me to study the topic from the father of OKR who came up with the methodology—John Doer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of companies create organization-wide objectives, but they don’t translate them down into personal OKRs. That’s right — and creating that cascade is one of the powerful parts of the system. The book says that there are four superpowers. On reflection, I think there are really five benefits that you get out of this. Focus is the first, because these are limited in number. Alignment is the one you’re talking about — you get everybody aligned. Commitment is third. When you’ve transparently set these goals, and all your colleagues see them, commitment clears that up quickly. And then the fourth superpower is tracking the progress. This is why Bill Gates uses the system at the Gates Foundation. Then the fifth superpower is stretching. Larry Page of Google is the high priest of 10x-ing everything, stretching further. He’ll say, I’d rather have the objective be to go to Mars, and if we fall short, we’ll get to the moon. This is how you make moonshots. Focus, alignment, commitment, tracking and stretching, I love that because it spells FACTS. And I can remember it. How do OKRs differ from, or complement, an Agile system? Agile guides your day-to-day work. OKRs don’t govern your day-to-day behavior. I’d say this is more of a weekly check-in. But it’s not set the goals and then stuff them away in a drawer and ignore them. People really care whether or not the CEO is watching their goals or cheering them on. If a leader wants a way to reach down into an organization, this is a great tool for doing it. You even use OKRs in your personal life? Yes, it can work against any agenda. I have had a set of personal objectives and key results. Most of mine have been around family. Now both daughters are off to school, but years ago I read and believed that having family dinners together was a key to having a happy family. So my key result was to get home for dinner by 6PM at least 20 nights a month, and be present, with our phones in another room. And that’s pretty hard to do. I was living in the 70% threshold is a good result — that would mean 14 or 15 nights a month. That’s an example of how OKRs can span any range of human activity. They’re transparent vessels that describe the “what” and the “how.” The values we pour into those vessels are the answers for the question, “Why?” — John Doer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If implemented right, OKRs can drive 5 things—focus, alignment, commitment, tracking progress and stretching (FACTS).</p>\n<p>OKRs are not perfect. In the absence of strong leadership or the absence of a visionary leader, the entire organization could be working on wrong things if objectives are not bold enough for the business. OKRs also do not allow for what isn't under your control. Self-worth is tied into objective and key results, but the individual does not have full control over its environment. Though Doerr argues against tying performance into key results, but hardly seen this in practical world. A system is equally responsible for failure to meet its objective.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, OKRs are valuable in driving focus for the entire organization and measure progress against set objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>John Doerr is the father of OKR who is responsible for bringing OKRs to Google and the world. He transformed Andy Grove's managerial system from Intel and made the process formal through OKR. Andy Grove was best known for driving operational excellence at Intel during its peak. Following were Grove's managerial philosophy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less is more–each objective should be tied to no more than five key results.</li>\n<li>Set goals from the bottom up—team members are motivated when individuals set their own OKRs.</li>\n<li>No dictating—OKRs are “a cooperative social contract,” so there should always be space for debating and negotiations.</li>\n<li>Stay flexible–in a fast changing environment, objectives can stop being relevant, so it should always be easy to modify them, together with the key results.</li>\n<li>Dare to fail—some OKRs should be uncomfortable, even unattainable, which means you’d need to be ready to fail.</li>\n<li>A tool, not a weapon—OKRs are not legal documents according to which you’re expected to measure your performance.</li>\n<li>Be patient—it’s next to impossible to fully understand the mechanism of the system in one cycle (1 quarter); five quarterly cycles should be enough to see how the goals actually perform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>\n<p>OKR is short for <em>Objective and Key Results</em>. Both are collaboratively driven by an entire organization to execute on the vision and strategic goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective</strong>: answers the WHAT is to be achieved.</li>\n<li><strong>Key Results</strong>: answers the HOW is it going to be achieved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If implemented correctly, it drives focus and transparency while eliminating conflicting priorities.</p>\n<p>An illustrative example of OKRs in an organization:</p>\n<p><em>CEO</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: gain ice-cream market share in Chicago.</li>\n<li>Key Results: sell 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week in neighborhoods with large population.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Head of Manufacturing</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: produce 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week.</li>\n<li>Key Result: make 150,000 gallons of vanilla ice-cream a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Head of Sales</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: sell 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week.</li>\n<li>Key Result 1: create a referral program to achieve >90% brand recommendation from existing buyers.</li>\n<li>Key Result 2: create a brand promotion with summer camp organizations to sell ice-cream during game days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is simple, but an illustrative example of OKR in action. It ties back into CEO's objective which cascades down to every business unit.</p>\n<p>The secret sauce of OKRs is in the Key Results.</p>\n<p>Performance should be measured by results (note, not tied to employee compensation). Each key result is measurable and verifiable. This is the best way to align incentives. Results should be regularly updated every quarter. If results are not achieved within a defined timeframe, it is time to reassess.</p>\n<p>A key point to remember—progress should be measured by outcome not an output otherwise goals are up for gamification. For example, Wells Fargo's organizational goals led personal bankers to open fake customer accounts to meet the quota. The goals backfired and took Wells Fargo into compliance trouble. Key results should be set intentional to ensure they cannot be tricked.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the goal is not to create a feature factory machine, but to solve a business problem and create organizational value. If organization is structured and aligned correctly, OKRs can be extremely effective by ensuring all members of the organization are working toward the same goals.</p>\n<p><strong>OKR superpowers</strong></p>\n<p>The 5 superpowers of OKRs—focus, alignment, commitment, tracking progress and stretching.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus—the organization on what matters for the company to survive and function.</li>\n<li>Align—OKRs to individual goals and the company’s game plan. Identify cross-team dependencies that require collaboration. For sound decision-making, and superior performance, top-line goals must be clearly understood throughout the organization and shared throughout the entire organization.</li>\n<li>Commit—to goals 100% which are supposed to be achieved within a specific time limit.</li>\n<li>Track for accountability—OKRs are driven by data and require periodic check-ins for objective grading, done in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. Google scores on 0 to 1.0 system:\n<ul>\n<li>0.7 to 1.0 is green</li>\n<li>0.4 to 0.6 is yellow</li>\n<li>0.0 to 0.3 is red</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stretch your goals—aspirational objectives are those that go beyond your everyday routine and are more about your vision of the company’s future. They are not always attainable, but necessary for management and contributors to challenge themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If companies don’t continue to innovate, they’re going to die—and I didn’t say iterate, I said innovate. — Bill Campbell</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Continuous performance management</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feedback is an opinion, grounded in observations and experiences, which allows us to know what impression we make on others. — Sheryl Sandberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OKRs set the context for Continuous Performance Management (CFR). CFRs help promote transparency, accountability, empowerment, and teamwork.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conversations—an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and individual contributor aimed at driving performance.</li>\n<li>Feedback—bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement. For example, “We are constantly surrounded by positive reinforcement and feedback, but many of us haven’t been trained to seek it out. Say you give a presentation to your team. After the fact, somebody comes up to you and says, ‘Hey, nice job.’ Most of us would say, ‘Oh great, thanks,’ and move on. But we want to probe a little deeper: ‘Thank you. What one thing did you like about it?’ The idea is to capture more specific feedback in real time.”</li>\n<li>Recognition—expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Relationship between OKRs and culture</strong></p>\n<p>Culture eats strategy for breakfast. OKRs are the raw ingredients to make that breakfast.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Culture is a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the way things are done and should be done in a company. The point is that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential. — Andy Grove</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A culture that drives focus, alignment and meaning will always win. If an organization believes the work they are doing, members of the organization will feel empowered and motivated to show up. OKRs should be set in a way that answer the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structure and clarity—are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?</li>\n<li>Psychological safety—can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?</li>\n<li>Meaning of work—are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?</li>\n<li>Dependability—can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?</li>\n<li>Impact of work—do we fundamentally believe that the work we are doing matters?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/measure-what-matters/\">Measure What Matters Book Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/high-output-management/\">High Output Management Book Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en\">John Doerr Ted Talk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/company-wide-okr-ideas-examples\">What Matters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://okrexamples.co\">OKR Examples</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/okr-mistakes\">OKR Mistakes by Adobe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sachinrekhi.com/bill-walsh-the-score-takes-care-of-itself\">Alternative of an OKR</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>Now Next Later</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>This is one of the best frameworks for roadmapping and planning.

Upon entering the space on the other side of the door, we are able to see the consequences of our decisions. Unfortunately, because it’s a one-way door, if we don’t like what we see, we can’t turn around and walk out through the door again. This is what Bezos calls a “Level 1 decision.” For these types of decisions, we want to be cautious, data-driven, and deliberate in our decision-making.</p>\n<p>With a two-way door decision, on the other hand, when we walk through the door, if we don’t like what we see, we get to turn around and undo our decision. This is what Bezos calls a “Level 2 decision.” He suggests that, with a two-way door decision, we’ll learn more by acting—walking through the door and seeing what’s on the other side—than we would by trying to imagine what’s on the other side of the door.</p>\n<p>Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, made this exact argument in his 2015 letter to shareholders,33 where he introduced the idea of Level 1 and Level 2 decisions. He describes a Level 1 decision as one that is hard to reverse, whereas a Level 2 decision is one that is easy to reverse. Bezos argues that we should be slow and cautious when making Level 1 decisions, but that we should move fast and not wait for perfect data when making Level 2 decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious, “If there are five ways to do something, we’ll study them, but let’s study them very quickly and make a decision.” We can always change our mind. Changing your mind, I talk about one-way doors and two-way doors, most decisions are two-way doors. If you make the wrong decision, if it’s a two-way door decision, you pick a door, you walk out and you spend a little time there. It turns out to be the wrong decision, you can come back in and pick another door. Some decisions are so consequential and so important and so hard to reverse that they really are one-way door decisions. You go in that door, you’re not coming back. And those decisions have to be made very deliberately, very carefully. If you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision, you should slow down and do that. So when I was CEO of Amazon, I often found myself in the position of being the chief slow down officer because somebody would be bringing me a one-way door decision and I would say, “Okay, I can think of three more ways to analyze that. So let’s go do that because we are not going to be able to reverse this one easily. Maybe you can reverse it if it’s going to be very costly and very time-consuming. We really have to get this one right from the beginning.” And what happens, unfortunately, in companies, what can happen, is that you have a one-size-fits-all decision-making process where you end up using the heavyweight process on all decisions. Two-way door decisions should mostly be made by single individuals or by very small teams deep in the organization. And one-way door decisions are the irreversible ones. Those are the ones that should be elevated up to the senior-most executives who should slow them down and make sure that the right thing is being done. Changing the decision is going to be very, very complicated. Some of them are technical decisions too because some technical decisions are like quick-drying cement. Once you make them, it gets really hard. Choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle, selecting LNG for the booster stage and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage, that has turned out to be a very good decision. But if you changed your mind, that would be a very big setback. So that’s the kind of decision you scrutinize very, very carefully. Other things just aren’t like that. Most decisions are not that way. Most decisions should be made by single individuals and done quickly in the full understanding that you can always change your mind. I’m here and I could say, “Lex, how tall do you think this ceiling is?” And you’d be like, “I don’t know, Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall.” And I would say, “I think it’s 11 feet tall.” And then we’d say, “You know what? Let’s just call it 11 and a half feet.” That’s compromise, instead of. The right thing to do is to get a tape measure or figure out some way of actually measuring, but think getting that tape measure and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling and all these things, that requires energy. Compromise, the advantage of compromise as a resolution mechanism is that it’s low energy, but it doesn’t lead to truth. And so in things like the height of the ceiling where truth is a noble thing, you shouldn’t allow compromise to be used when you can know the truth. — Jeff Bezos/Lex Fridman</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>3Ds</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>Annie Duke is a decision-making expert, former professional poker player, special partner at First Round Capital, and the author of Thinking in Bets (a national bestseller) and Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away.

It acknowledges the other person’s perspective while affirming your decision or stance.</li>\n<li>Replace confrontational language like “I disagree” or “you’re wrong” with phrases like “I don’t understand” so everyone feels heard and valued. If people feel heard, they are more likely to feel like they contributed to the decision, even when they disagree.</li>\n<li>Use pre-mortems to set kill criteria. Before starting a project, imagine failure and what early warning signs might have predicted it. Commit in advance to reassess or pivot if you notice those red flags later on.

In order to succeed in implementing this framework, work to gain a deep understanding of those jobs, and then create offerings that will help customers get their jobs done significantly better and/or more cheaply.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The whole premise of JTBD is that people hire products, they don't buy them, they hire them to make progress in their life.</li>\n<li>The primary cause of failed products and services is a misalignment with customer needs. Using the JTBD framework product teams can deeply understand the jobs its customers are trying to get done and the metrics they use to measure success. It can help determine which needs are unmet or discover segments of customers with unique sets of unmet needs.</li>\n<li>Context makes the irrational rational. For example, think of Snickers and Milky Way.\n<ul>\n<li>“They're both candy bars, they're both bought in the checkout aisle, they're both made almost with the same ingredients, one has peanuts, one doesn't. And if you start to compare the products and do a competitive benchmark, you start to get to one's a little softer, one's a little harder, one's got a few more calories, one's got less calories. But when you talk to people about when's the last time they ate a Snickers, when time's the last time they ate a Milky Way, you start to realize that Snickers typically is a case where they missed the last meal, they've got a lot of work to do, they're running out of energy and they want to basically get back to the tasks as fast as possible. And so you start to realize that Snickers is about almost like a meal replacement and it's about the stomach is growling and things like that. And you start to realize that if they didn't have a Snickers, it competes with a protein drink, it competes with a Red Bull, a coffee. But a Milky Way typically is eaten after an emotional experience, could be positive, could be negative. It's usually eaten alone, and it's taking time to regroup after this emotional thing. And you start to realize that it competes with things like a glass of wine, a brownie, and to be honest, a run. And so when you start to realize that, jobs helps you see the true competitive set from what we call the demand side of the world as opposed to the competitive set from the supply side of the world, which is the technology or the underlying business model by how which we're making it. And so it allows you to actually see what customers really want as opposed to trying to figure out, how do we sell things to people?” — Bob Moesta</li>\n<li>“One of the lies I was told growing up was build it and they will come.” — Bob Moesta</li>\n<li>“Stop trying to sell people and just help them make progress, help them buy.” — Bob Moesta</li>\n<li>“There's the difference between what they say they want and what they want.” — Bob Moesta</li>\n<li>“I use the framework of pushes, pulls, anxieties and habits and say, \"What caused them to do this?\"” — Bob Moesta</li>\n<li>“I never trust anybody telling me things they're going to do because they can't assure it, and it usually never happens.  Just because people bitch about something doesn't mean they're going to do anything about it....So for example, in the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you, \"I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever,\" and it's like they have all these things and then when you start to get to, it's like, no, the old car had 280,000 miles on it....The fact is it's making a sound and you've got a long trip coming up, that's why you're getting a car. You're not getting the car because of the deal. And so there's these, I call it the layers of language.” — Bob Moesta</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The value of value depends on where a client starting from and where they want to go. The value of an outcome is much more if you are starting all the way at the bottom as opposed to closer to the top.</li>\n<li>There are 3 levels of dimension of information/energy that needs to be retrieved from a job executor (customer/client/user):\n<ul>\n<li>Functional Energy: The core part of their jobs that requires time, space, effort or knowledge.</li>\n<li>Emotional Energy: The emotional aspect of which is how I feel, I want to feel better, I feel frustrated, or I feel overlooked.</li>\n<li>Social Energy: The social aspect of how I want others to perceive me or how others perceive me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Understand the causation behind the client's job and then use design thinking to craft client enablement for people to make progress.</li>\n<li>Most people say, \"If I just add more features, create more pull, people will buy.\" It's not true. More features create anxiety. Reduce friction and create make it easier for people to make progress.</li>\n<li>“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill.

Focusing on outcome rather than output.</li>\n<li>Customer-centric. Really understanding your customers.</li>\n<li>Collaborative. Getting the right people involved in discovery.</li>\n<li>Visual. Using the opportunity solution tree, among other tools to map-out what you want to learn in discovery.</li>\n<li>Experimental. Making the process hypothesis-driven and learning all the time.</li>\n<li>Continuous. Making discovery an ongoing part of business-as-usual rather than a one-off activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think in the structure of trees. It helps us deconstruct large, intractable problems into a series of smaller, more solvable problems. The value of breaking big opportunities into a series of smaller opportunities is twofold. First, it allows us to tackle problems that otherwise might seem unsolvable. Second, it allows us to deliver value over time. That second benefit is at the heart of the Agile manifesto and is a key tenet of continuous improvement.</p>\n<p>The biggest barrier to testing assumptions is becoming aware of the assumptions we are making. sizes. As product trios, we are primarily concerned with assumptions in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desirability assumptions: Does anyone want it? Will our customers get value from it?</li>\n<li>Viability assumptions: Should we build it?</li>\n<li>Feasibility assumptions: Can we build it?</li>\n<li>Usability assumptions: Is it usable? Can customers find what they need? Will</li>\n<li>Ethical assumptions: Is there any potential harm in building this idea? This is an area that is grossly underdeveloped for many product trios.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are a few other concepts from Teresa Torres.</p>\n<p>Opportunity solution tree (OST): Opportunity solution trees are a simple way of visually representing the paths you might take to reach a desired outcome. The root of the tree is your desired outcome—the business need that reflects how your team can create business value. Opportunity solution trees help you resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs. As you embark on the wandering paths of discovery, your tree will act as your roadmap, helping you find the best path to your desired outcome.</p>\n<p>Skipping “whether or not” decision is when we frame a problem as “Should we do this or not?” Instead of framing our decisions as “whether or not” decisions, develop a “compare and contrast” mindset. Instead of asking, “Should we solve this customer need?” we’ll ask, “Which of these customer needs is most important for us to address right now?” We’ll compare and contrast our options.</p>\n<p>A business outcome (for example, retention) measures how well the business is progressing. A product outcome (for example, customers like your ice cream) measures how well the product is moving the business forward. A traction metric measures usage of a specific feature (for example, customers like the waffle cones) or workflow in the product.</p>\n<p>Experience map: An experience map that reflects what you know about your customers’ experience today while answering outcome questions. Each individual comes up with their own visuals. Then the team combines all of their maps together. This shared map will guide your customer interviews, and it will help give structure to the opportunity space. It can and should evolve week over week as your team learns about your customers.\nInterview snapshot: An interview snapshot is a one-pager designed to help you synthesize what you learned in a single interview. It’s how you are going to turn your copious notes into actionable insights. Your collection of snapshots will act as a reference or index to the customer knowledge bank you are building through continuous interviewing.</p>\n<p>Opportunity assessment: teams assess opportunities using the following criteria: opportunity sizing, market factors, company factors, and customer factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity sizing helps us answer the questions: How many customers are affected and how often?</li>\n<li>Market factors help us evaluate how addressing each opportunity might affect our position in the market.</li>\n<li>Company factors help us evaluate the strategic impact of each opportunity for our company, business group, or team.</li>\n<li>Customer factors help us evaluate how important each opportunity is to our customers.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<h3 id=\"business-strategy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#business-strategy\" aria-label=\"business strategy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Business strategy</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Framework</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7 Powers</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7 Powers is arguably the best business strategic framework which includes scale economics, switching costs, cornered resource, counter positioning, branding, network effects, and process.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Wardley Maps</em></td>\n<td align=\"center\">They provide situational awareness and shared assumptions about a context necessary for building a sound strategy.

It is a representation of the landscape in which a business operates. Inspired by military strategy, Simon Wardley created this framework to give businesses a clear view of their “battlefield.” Wardley Mapping forces you to see the big picture not just WHAT you’re building, but WHY it matters, WHEN it’s needed, and WHERE you can gain a competitive edge. It helps you move from reactive firefighting to proactive strategic thinking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simon Wardley, the technique’s inventor, describes strategy using Sun Tzu’s Five Factors:\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: What’s the goal or game\" you’re playing? A wise leader has a purpose (a what and a why). This is the force that compels you to do what you do and make what you make. It’s the higher reason for doing your work, often called your moral imperative. What’s the goal or “game” you’re playing?</li>\n<li>Landscape: A wise leader grasps the terrain because every organization operates within a landscape that represents the context for its decisions (leader has a map). This is the context: a mapping of the competitive environment in which you operate.</li>\n<li>Climate: A wise leader anticipates the patterns of the forces acting on the environment. There are always external forces manipulating the environment. In the same way that you don’t control the weather, you don’t control external forces like trends and the economy. But you can be aware of the climate and learn how best to prepare for it.</li>\n<li>Doctrine: A wise leader trains the organization in universally useful principles. Just as a religion has a core set of beliefs, your company will have a certain set of principles that will be applied to any situation.</li>\n<li>Leadership: A wise leader makes shrewd decisions that lead to victory. This is the strategy that you’ll determine after you consider your purpose, landscape, and climate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It consists of a value chain (activities needed to fulfill user needs) graphed against evolution (how individual activities change over time under supply and demand competition). The Wardley Map represents your value chain through three main components:\n<ul>\n<li>Users: Who are the beneficiaries of your product?</li>\n<li>Needs: What are their core needs and pain points?</li>\n<li>Capabilites: How do you deliver value through different capabilities?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In Wardley Maps, the y-axis (vertical) represents visibility to the user. Like a traditional value chain, the higher the component, the more the user can see it. For example, a web page might be at the top, while a database or a server might be near the bottom. The x-axis (horizontal) contains the four stages of evolution:\n<ul>\n<li>I. Genesis: The object is rare, poorly understood, and uncertain. There is the potential to have high future worth. The object is described with wonder, and it’s different from anything else in the market in this context. It should be a competitive advantage and experimentation is rife.</li>\n<li>II. Custom Built: More people are starting to consume and understand the object. The market is forming, and there is potential ROI. As understanding increases, users start to find its value, but inconsistently. The key focus is learning.</li>\n<li>III. Product Rental: Consumption is rapidly increasing as the market grows. The object is profitable, new features can differentiate it, and there is a refinement of needs.

It helped the founders of Warby Parker create a company worth over $1B. Their analysis showed that the eyewear industry is dominated by a single player, Luxottica, which kept prices of prescription glasses artificially high. A pair was priced at around $300 even though it cost only $10-$20 to produce. The best framework for industry analysis is Porter’s Five Forces. It evaluates five competitive forces, which influence industry attractiveness. The basic idea is that your product or company is not competing just with direct competitors but with everyone in the ecosystem, including customers, suppliers, substitutes, and new entrants. For example, you might have very few competitors but you still can’t make any profit because your suppliers have more negotiating power and so they capture most of the profits.</p>\n<p>Overview of Porter’s Five Forces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Threat of new entrants: How hard is it to enter an industry?</li>\n<li>Bargaining power of buyers: How easily can buyers drive our prices down? How well can they negotiate?</li>\n<li>Threat of substitutes: How else can customers satisfy the same need?</li>\n<li>Bargaining power of suppliers: how easily can suppliers drive their prices up? How well can they negotiate?</li>\n<li>Rivalry amongst existing competitors: How many competitors are in an industry? How strong are they?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. — Michael Porter</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it's about deliberately choosing to be different. — Michael Porter</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>The Lean Canvas</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>The Lean Canvas is a one-page visual business plan that's ongoing and actionable.

It will supply the metrics you need to prioritize a long-delayed UI for a complex application.</p>\n<p>Google applies three criteria to each HEART Metric: Goal, Signals, and Metrics. The criteria ranges from the qualitative to the quantitative.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Goal is a high-level description of what you want to achieve.</li>\n<li>Signals indicate what you can measure as you work toward your Goal.</li>\n<li>Metrics include concrete data that can show your progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is more on the five metrics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Happiness: Happiness is the state of being happy, which varies based on individual user attitudes. It’s relative and hard to quantify. In the HEART framework, Happiness is measured with user surveys.</li>\n<li>Engagement: Engagement captures the user’s involvement. For consumer-facing web applications, the user equates to the person who logged into the application. This is not as straightforward for enterprise applications. Ask yourself:\n<ul>\n<li>Did a human perform an action, like create a new record?</li>\n<li>Did an application use your application to communicate with another application? Did it read or write data?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Adoption and Retention: Adoption looks at new users while Retention tracks the longevity of all users. Adoption and Retention metrics can be used to provide stronger insight into counts of the number of unique users in a given time period (e.g. seven-day active users), addressing the problem of distinguishing new users from existing users. Adoption metrics track how many new users start using a product during a given time period (for example, the number of accounts created in the last seven days), and Retention metrics track how many of the users from a given time period are still present in some later time period (for example, the percentage of seven-day active users in a given week who are still seven-day active three months later). What counts as \"using\" a product can vary depending on its nature and goals.</li>\n<li>Task Success: This category encompasses several traditional behavioral metrics of user experience, such as efficiency (e.g. time to complete a task), effectiveness (e.g. percent of tasks completed), and error rate. One way to measure these on a large scale is via a remote usability or benchmarking study, where users can be assigned specific tasks. With web server log file data, it can be difficult to know which task the user was trying to accomplish, depending on the nature of the site. If an optimal path exists for a particular task (e.g. a multi-step sign-up process) it is possible to measure how closely users follow it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further reading**</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalone.com/tech/software-engineering/heart-framework-enterprise-applications/\">Why Google HEART framework?

While each of these can drive growth for your company, it’s important to choose the most relevant one for your service offering and business strategy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Sticky Engine of Growth: If you’re focused on retaining customers for the long term, this is the engine you need to focus on. Maintaining a low customer attrition is absolutely critical. You need to do everything you can to keep your customers coming back month after month. Once you have an exceptionally low attrition rate, you only need to acquire a few new customers to keep your business growing. Before focusing on finding new customers, focus on your current ones. The fundamental KPI for stickiness are:\n<ul>\n<li>Customer Retention</li>\n<li>Churn Rates</li>\n<li>Usage Frequency</li>\n<li>Time Since Last Visit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Viral Engine of Growth: This is the domain of word of mouth and having your product advertise itself. Either by telling their friends or simply using your product, your customers will do your advertising for you. The most critical element of this engine is making sure the every customer brings more than one friend to your business. If 10 of your customers bring 11 of their friends to you, your business will grow rapidly. Because those 11 will bring 11 (or 12) of their friends. Every group will be bigger than the last and you’ll get compounding growth. Be careful about relying on this engine of growth, it’s incredibly difficult to build intentionally. For you to rely on viral marketing, your product needs to be absolutely incredible and fit your target market perfectly. If everything isn’t perfect, the viral loop will hit a dead end and you’ll run out of customers without other marketing. The key metric for this engine is:\n<ul>\n<li>Viral Coefficient (the number of new users each user brings on)</li>\n<li>Viral Cycle Time (the speed with which a user invites another)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Paid Engine of Growth: This is what most business owners are familiar with and every form of advertising falls into this category. Whether you’re using the yellow pages or Super Bowel ads, you’re buying your customers. When operating on this engine, each customer needs to give you a profit. If you’re spending a $1.00 to acquire a customer, you better be making enough to cover the $1.00, your other expenses, and leave a bit of profit left over. As long as you’re making a profit on each customer, you can invest those profits into more advertising to accelerate growth. Purchasing ads, employing sales teams, and leasing expensive real estate for foot traffic are all examples of the paid engine of growth. Make sure your costs are covered.
