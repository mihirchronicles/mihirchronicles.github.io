The sector encompasses a wide range of public and private companies and institutions (including governments and endowments) that provide various money management and wealth management solutions.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I was fascinated by the ticker symbols flowing through the television screen. This forced me to be curious about the industry. I bought my first stock at the age of 17, which happened to be right before the 2008 recession. I have used this industry as a crutch to fulfill my dreams. American dynamism also flows through the robust capital markets. It has allowed so many to dream and build. It's not perfect by any stretch, but this imperfect path has made America a compounding machine.</p>\n<p>I first got a taste of capital markets during my internship at the Chicago Board of Trade. I got to see old school trading (non-electronic). During college, I had the privilege of attending a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting (Woodstock for Capitalists) without owning a single share (thanks to my finance professor). I got to see my personal heroes, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, speak live. These experiences gave me a deeper appreciation for the industry.</p>\n<p>So far, I have worked for two major investment firms—Morningstar and Charles Schwab who are major players supporting capital markets solutions to their clients. These experiences further solidified my interest in the financial services industry. My obsession keeps growing for this industry.</p>\n<p>Below is my attempt to capture what I <em>know</em> and what I have <em>learned</em> so far from building products and services within the space.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Bio</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Donor Advised Funds</em></td>\n<td align=\"center\">A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable giving vehicle that allows individuals, families, and businesses to make tax-deductible contributions to a sponsoring organization, which then holds and invests the funds in a separate account. The donor retains advisory privileges over how the funds are distributed to qualified charitable organizations over time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Separately Managed Accounts</em></td>\n<td align=\"center\">It is an investment portfolio owned and managed by a professional asset management firm, often a registered investment advisor (RIA). Unlike mutual funds or ETFs, SMAs allow investors to directly own individual securities and customize their portfolio to align with their specific financial goals and preferences.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Robo-advisors</em></td>\n<td align=\"center\">Robo-advisors are automated investment platforms that use algorithms to provide financial planning and portfolio management services with minimal human intervention.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>Donor Advised Funds</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) is a charitable giving account established at a public charity, known as the sponsoring organization, which manages and administers the fund on behalf of the donor. Eligible contributions such as cash, or appreciated securities generally allow for immediate tax deduction. The assets in the DAF can then be invested for tax-free growth. Grants can be recommended from DAF account to any eligible IRS-qualified public charity at any time.</p>\n<p>The competitive landscape includes traditional wealth management firms, community foundations, and newer technology-focused providers, each offering different fee structures, investment options, and service levels to attract donors and their financial advisors.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Services</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Contribution: Donors contribute cash, securities, or other assets to their DAF account and receive an immediate tax deduction for the full fair market value of the contribution.</li>\n<li>Investment Growth: The sponsoring organization invests the contributed funds, allowing them to potentially grow tax-free over time while awaiting distribution to charities.</li>\n<li>Grant Recommendations: Donors can recommend grants from their DAF to qualified charitable organizations whenever they choose. While the sponsoring organization has legal control over the funds, they typically honor the donor's recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Advantages</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tax Benefits: Immediate tax deduction upon contribution, even if grants are made years later. This allows donors to \"bunch\" charitable deductions in high-income years.</li>\n<li>Investment Growth: Funds can be invested and grow tax-free, potentially increasing the total amount available for charitable giving.</li>\n<li>Flexibility: Donors can take time to research charities and make thoughtful giving decisions without time pressure.</li>\n<li>Simplified Administration: The sponsoring organization handles all the administrative work, tax reporting, and due diligence on recipient charities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major Players</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fidelity Charitable</li>\n<li>Schwab Charitable</li>\n<li>Daffy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More on DAFs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DAF is mostly the United States concept.</li>\n<li>DAFs were originated by community foundations to boost charitable giving. The first DAF was created in 1931 by the New York Community Trust. Overtime commercial investment services got involved which boosted charitable giving further.</li>\n<li>DAF — donor advised fund is an investment account which could be opened via a brokerage service that lets you take a tax deduction when contributions are made and give the money to a charity later.</li>\n<li>DAF allows for maximizing granting by investing the money tax-free.</li>\n<li>A grant can be made anytime from a DAF to a charity of your choice. Approval of a grant is at DAF sponsor's discretionary based on their internal policies.</li>\n<li>DAF provider charges an administrative fee to invest your DAF and make donations when you recommend them. Administrative fee varies based on an account balance and contributions.</li>\n<li>Investment options are limited to index funds unless you have a professionally managed account which requires a high account balance. There are certain players who are starting to offer ETFs but not widely adopted.</li>\n<li>DAF is a 501(c)3 organization which needs to comply with <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds\">IRS guidelines</a>.</li>\n<li>While there are certain charity exemption rules, IRS qualified charities need to meet eligibility requirements. More from <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-and-nonprofits\">IRS</a>.</li>\n<li>IRS provides <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf\">The Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract</a> which provides information about an organization from the Internal Revenue Service's Business Master File. It has the most recent information the IRS has for these organizations.</li>\n<li>There are IRS guidelines on <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds\">charitable contributions</a>. Contribution type varies from cash to non-cash to complex assets.</li>\n<li>To be eligible to claim a tax deduction in a given tax year, you must complete the contribution to your DAF by the last day of the year — December 31.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>Separately Managed Accounts</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>The investment management world is divided into retail and institutional investors. Products designed for middle-income individual investors, such as the retail classes of mutual funds, have modest initial investment requirements: $1,000 or even less. In contrast, managed accounts or funds for institutions have imposed minimum investment requirements of $25 million or more.</p>\n<p>Between these ends of the spectrum, however, is the growing universe of separately managed accounts (SMA) targeted toward wealthy (but not necessarily ultra-wealthy) individual investors. Whether you refer to them as “individually managed accounts,” “separate account,” or “separately managed accounts,” these individual-oriented managed accounts have gone mainstream.</p>\n<p>SMAs differ from pooled vehicles like mutual funds in that each portfolio is unique to a single account (hence the name). In other words, if you set up a separate account with Money Manager X, then Manager X has the discretion to make decisions for this account that may be different from decisions made for other accounts. Mutual funds cannot offer, due to their structure as investments shared by a group of investors, the benefit of customized portfolio management. Separate accounts overcome this barrier.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct Ownership: Investors own the underlying securities directly, rather than owning shares in a pooled fund.</li>\n<li>Customization: SMAs offer flexibility to tailor the portfolio to specific needs, such as excluding certain sectors or companies.</li>\n<li>Professional Management: SMAs are managed by professional investment firms who make investment decisions on the investor's behalf.</li>\n<li>Tax Advantages: SMAs can offer tax-efficient strategies like tax-loss harvesting and can avoid embedded capital gains that mutual funds may have.</li>\n<li>Higher Minimums and Fees: SMAs typically require higher minimum investment amounts and come with higher management fees compared to mutual funds or ETFs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits of SMAs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalization: Investors can tailor their portfolios to their specific needs, values, and risk tolerance.</li>\n<li>Tax Efficiency: Tax-loss harvesting and avoidance of embedded capital gains can lead to tax savings.</li>\n<li>Transparency:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Investors have direct access to their portfolio and holdings, unlike mutual funds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control: Investors can work with their financial advisor to set parameters and guidelines for managing their investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Who Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-net-worth individuals: SMAs are often suitable for individuals with significant assets who want to customize their investment strategies.</li>\n<li>Those seeking personalized investment solutions: SMAs are ideal for investors who want to align their portfolios with their values, goals, and tax situation.</li>\n<li>Individuals seeking greater control and transparency: SMAs provide investors with more direct control over their investments and a clear view of their holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Things to Consider</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher Minimums and Fees: SMAs have higher minimum investment requirements and management fees compared to mutual funds and ETFs.</li>\n<li>Complexity: The level of customization and detail in SMAs can be more complex than traditional investment vehicles.\n<ul>\n<li>Limited Diversification for Smaller Accounts:</li>\n<li>It can be challenging to achieve optimal diversification with smaller balances in SMAs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major Players</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charles Schwab</li>\n<li>Fidelity</li>\n<li>Blackrock</li>\n<li>JP Morgan Chase</li>\n<li>Goldman Sachs</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n    <summary><strong>Robo-advisors</strong></summary>\n    <br>\n<p>Robo-advisors are digital platforms that automatically create and manage investment portfolios based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. They use modern portfolio theory and algorithms to build diversified portfolios primarily composed of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A risk assessment is required during account open based on investor's suitability and willingness amongst other criteria.</p>\n<p>Robo-advisors work well for investors who want professional portfolio management at low cost, prefer hands-off investing, are comfortable with technology, have straightforward financial situations, and are focused on long-term wealth building rather than active trading. They're particularly suitable for young professionals, new investors, busy individuals who don't want to manage investments themselves, and cost-conscious investors seeking diversified portfolios.
