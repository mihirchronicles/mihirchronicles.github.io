What might seem beautiful to one person might not be the same for others.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is simple. Reality depends on experiences (simulations) which is where true taste comes from.</p>\n<p>Examining reality objectively is challenging because of perceptions accumulated overtime based on the simulations played. There is an American simulation and a Chinese simulation. There are simulations played at home, school, work, and in communities. Another form of simulation comes in the form of books and building things. There are other simulations people play depending on how far their reach is or which part of wealth spectrum they fall under.</p>\n<p>How do you cultivate taste when these forces are at play?</p>\n<p>I don't know where taste sits on the spectrum of nature versus nurture. But from my personal experience, motivation to build beautiful things goes deeper than just money or status. You obsess over a few things in life so much that you become its biggest cheerleader so that it is useful to others for a long period.</p>\n<p>The primary features of a beautiful object are <em>usefulness and long-lasting</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's take trees for an example. Trees are beautiful. It's uncommon to come across people who do not view it the same. What is a tree? Staring at it simply, it is a big brown pole with asymmetrical shape and branches overflowing with leaves. They look dry and pale looking during extreme weather. The way they grow overtime and take their shape tells me they do not care about their aesthetic. If the sole purpose is to judge them by their appearance, it also seems to me they are purely a waste of space on this planet. By this argument, trees are selfish. But we know they go beyond a brown pole and a splash of green around them.</p>\n<p>The most astonishing thing about trees is how social they are. Trees establish friendships with their surrounding neighbors via their root systems. The give and take is vital for working together. This practice helps create a consistent climate that moderates extreme heat and cold. To achieve this, the community must remain intact, regardless of any challenges. Every tree in the forest is valuable to the community. This is just one of their useful features. Supporting the planet with food, oxygen, shelter and medicine are just a few other examples of how critical they are in sustaining the guests on our planet. These trees stand together for decades, centuries and millennia.</p>\n<p>The usefulness and long-lasting features make trees attractive. The functionality of an object gives rise to the beauty. A leaf on a tree has a certain function. The leaf’s beauty lies not in its stylish design, but in its perfect natural form—a testament to its essential function.</p>\n<p>The taste is not so much about style then, but the work that feels as natural as a leaf on a tree. In design, taste is a currency. Hence, we think great creators come with taste. It is not as much about colors, shapes, sizes, style, mood or imagination. The taste is in discovery and when it takes its shape the end product feels natural.</p>\n<p>As artificial intelligence advances, it appears that all one needs to do is type a few words and press a button to generate a glorious AI image. That is no different from photographers clicking a button on their camera. In both cases, you get an image. The creator's work is in discovery.</p>\n<p>In addition to discovery, taste requires creators to be sensitive to their environment to capture details. We are all different, but we all have the same fears. Understanding what is universal versus what is unique can be advantageous to a creator. Taste requires emotional tolerance and self-conscious.</p>\n<p>Having a beautifully decorated wall doesn’t necessarily indicate your taste. What truly matters is how you express your taste in your surroundings—the way you welcome guests at home, treat your colleagues, and collaborate with them. Your overall ambiance and demeanor reflect your taste. Your vibe is taste.</p>\n<p>You also don't have to be a creator to be tasteful. Taste comes in emotion, moral values and judgement. Taste in ideas isn't enough. Taste and righteousness don't go well together. Taste is rooted in opinions, not an objective truth. There are several paths to get to taste even though you might come across a virtuous individual with great taste.</p>\n<p>Taste isn't the same as expensive as riches portray. Taste can come from being thrifty and work ethic. Taste can be acquired from the worst experiences. Constraints are positive for taste building. The less to work with, the more you can use your energy to discover and observe.</p>\n<p>Lastly, be cautious of individuals who are trying to signal superficial trends. Remember, one of the features of beauty is its long-lasting nature.</p>\n<p>Hunting is the art that elevates nature’s beauty to a visible eye that we perceive as taste. This is why creativity knows no bounds, and individuals with refined tastes will always find employment and enrich their lives.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Ode To Taste Building","date":"March 01, 2025","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-artificial-intelligence/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Artificial Intelligence"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"31b37351-ef05-5ff6-b5c1-201d75911226","previousPostId":"15f50cf0-6fef-556c-b63f-c446560733ff","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3204476847"],"slicesMap":{}}
