Other times, we must proactively explore problems to get them prioritized. In both instances, success relies on a clear problem statement and measurable outcomes.</p>\n<p>The trap is rushing into “solution mode.” This must be resisted until thorough discovery is conducted. Problem exploration is messy, so where do you start?</p>\n<p>Start with Curiosity. Discovery is key.</p>\n<p>The best product managers aren't the ones with all the answers; they are the ones who know which questions to ask. Questions, not frameworks, are the true superpower of a product manager. Real breakthroughs come from asking the hard questions and understanding the underlying dynamics.</p>\n<p>To do this effectively, collect context from various groups. The broader and deeper your dimensions, the more nuances you will discover. Use the following dimensions to guide your discovery voyage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target Audience: Who are the users? How are they segmented? What channels do we support?</li>\n<li>**User-Defined Problem: How do they describe what's wrong? What are they exploring to solve their problem? How do they describe value in their own words?</li>\n<li>Behavioral Analysis: What are the user habits? What incentives are driving their current behavior?</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Analysis (External): Who else is affected? What power dynamics (regulations, policies) keep the status quo in place?</li>\n<li>Organization Dynamics (Internal): What are our assumptions? What are the non-negotiables and resource constraints? Is this actually a process problem pretended to be a tech problem? Is there a messaging or user behavior issue?</li>\n<li>Product &#x26; Technology: What capability gaps does our product have? Is the solution feasible within the timeline? Is the existing solution usable? If a solution is outsourced, how is the organization going to operationalize the solution?</li>\n<li>Adoption &#x26; Distribution: How will we validate the solution? (Did they ask for a vitamin, but we built a painkiller?) How are we going to scale our solution and maximize our impact? How are we going to drive early adopters? How do we influence the naysayers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have cast a wide net with these questions, you will have a mountain of data. Now, you must synthesize that noise into a signal using the “define the business problem framework” below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Problem: Clearly state the problem itself, ensuring it is not masked as a potential solution.</li>\n<li>Affected Parties: Who is directly and indirectly impacted?</li>\n<li>The True Impact: What are the tangible consequences? Be honest; is this a real business impact or just an annoyance?</li>\n<li>Defining Success: What specific value is delivered upon resolution? <em>Warning:</em> If your definition of success is “implementing X tech solution,” you have failed to define business value.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's put this framework in action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weak Problem Statement: “We lack a CRM, which complicates call management for our Customer Service team. Therefore, we should implement Salesforce.”\n<ul>\n<li><em>Critique:</em> This jumps directly to a solution (Salesforce) without quantifying the pain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effective Problem Statement: “The Customer Service team spends 40% of their time searching for data across disconnected systems, delaying issue resolution and creating inconsistent customer experience.”</li>\n<li>Affected Parties: 15 CSRs (direct frustration), Customers (wait times), Sales Team (missed upsell context).</li>\n<li>True Impact: Average handle time is 8 mins (vs. 5 min benchmark). Revenue impact estimated at $180K/year in lost productivity. CSR turnover up 25%.</li>\n<li>Success Definition: CSRs access customer context within 10 seconds. Handle time reduced to 5 minutes. CSAT (satisfaction) scores improve to 4.0+.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start with the problem first, solution last. Your product is flexible—you can build anything. But problems, channels, and business models are rigid constraints. Start there.</p>\n<p>Great problem statements come from curiosity. The best problem statements have both depth and complexity.</p>\n<p>As Seth Godin says—<em>It doesn't make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open. The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key.</em></p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Problem Exploration Guide","date":"November 15, 2025","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-upanishads/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Upanishads by Eknath Easwaran"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-ideal-team-player/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Ideal Team Player by Patrick Lencioni"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"49831c5f-8742-50cb-8c10-e7a788d8818c","previousPostId":"53db4c1c-f11b-5297-8cb5-5e7aa7002e0c","nextPostId":"2461008b-4f78-532a-bd66-7071d33a09ca"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3204476847"],"slicesMap":{}}
