Brief Summary</h2>\n<p>Anne Lamott offers basic instructions on how to write and manage discipline around writing. She is witty which makes reading this book fun. My takeaway—to become a better writer, you have to write more and first draft is always going to be terrible. Don't judge your first draft too harshly. Do not make perfectionism your friend. Writing reveals the story because you have to write to figure out what you're writing about.</p>\n<h2>II. Big Ideas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit down to work at approximately the same time every day.</li>\n<li>Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people.</li>\n<li>Becoming a better writer is going to help you become a better reader, and that is the real payoff.</li>\n<li>A writer paradoxically seeks the truth and tells lies every step of the way.</li>\n<li>Write shitty first drafts.</li>\n<li>Writing reveals itself through writing. As you write, you uncover the hidden gems inside you that you didn't even know were there. Words come to you, characters reveals themselves, and dialogue forms that shows who these people are. It pretty much always works this way—you have to write to figure out what you're writing about.</li>\n<li>There will be a lot of mistakes, things to edit out and other things that need to be added. You just aren’t always going to make the right decision and that’s okay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>III. Quotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he'd had three months to write. It was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said—“Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird”.</li>\n<li>One writer I know tells me that he sits down every morning and says to himself nicely, “It’s not like you don’t have a choice, because you do—you can either type or kill yourself.”</li>\n<li>Writing has so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of writing turns out to be its own reward.</li>\n<li>For some of us, books are as important as almost anything else on earth. What a miracle it is that out of these small, flat, rigid squares of paper unfolds world after world after world, worlds that sing to you, comfort and quiet or excite you. Books help us understand who we are and how we are to behave. They show us what community and friendship mean; they show us how to live and die.</li>\n<li>Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won't have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren't even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they're doing it.</li>\n<li>Perfectionism is one way our muscles cramp. In some cases we don't even know that the wounds and the cramping are there, but both limit us. They keep us moving and writing in tight, worried ways.</li>\n<li>You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.</li>\n<li>Remember that you own what happened to you. If your childhood was less than ideal, you may have been raised thinking that if you told the truth about what really went on in your family, a long bony white finger would emerge from a cloud and point to you, while a chilling voice thundered, “We <em>told</em> you not to tell.” But that was then. Just put down on paper everything you can remember now about your parents and siblings and relatives and neighbors, and we will deal with libel later on.</li>\n<li>Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life: they feed the soul. When writers make us shake our heads with the exactness of their prose and their truths, and even make us laugh about ourselves or life, our buoyancy is restored. We are given a shot at dancing with, or at least clapping along with, the absurdity of life, instead of being squashed by it over and over again. It's like singing on a boat during a terrible storm at sea. You can't stop the raging storm, but singing can change the hearts and spirits of the people who are together on that ship.</li>\n<li>E.L. Doctorow said once said that 'Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.' You don't have to see where you're going, you don't have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice on writing, or life, I have ever heard.</li>\n<li>You are lucky to be one of those people who wishes to build sand castles with words, who is willing to create a place where your imagination can wander. We build this place with the sand of memories; these castles are our memories and inventiveness made tangible. So part of us believes that when the tide starts coming in, we won't really have lost anything, because actually only a symbol of it was there in the sand. Another part of us thinks we'll figure out a way to divert the ocean. This is what separates artists from ordinary people: the belief, deep in our hearts, that if we build our castles well enough, somehow the ocean won't wash them away. I think this is a wonderful kind of person to be.</li>\n<li>Clutter and mess show us that life is being lived...Tidiness makes me think of held breath, of suspended animation... Perfectionism is a mean, frozen form of idealism, while messes are the artist's true friend. What people somehow forgot to mention when we were children was that we need to make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here.</li>\n<li>If something inside of you is real, we will probably find it interesting, and it will probably be universal. So you must risk placing real emotion at the center of your work. Write straight into the emotional center of things. Write toward vulnerability. Risk being unliked. Tell the truth as you understand it. If you’re a writer you have a moral obligation to do this. And it is a revolutionary act—truth is always subversive.</li>\n<li>Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere.</li>\n<li>I heard a preacher say recently that hope is a revolutionary patience; let me add that so is being a writer. Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.</li>\n<li>Because this business of becoming conscious, of being a writer, is ultimately about asking yourself, How alive am I willing to be?</li>\n<li>You don't always have to chop with the sword of truth. You can point with it too.</li>\n<li>Try looking at your mind as a wayward puppy that you are trying to paper train. You don't drop-kick a puppy into the neighbor's yard every time it piddles on the floor. You just keep bringing it back to the newspaper.</li>\n<li>“But how?\" my students ask. \"How do you actually do it?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You sit down, I say. You try to sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively. So you sit down at, say, nine every morning, or ten every night. You put a piece of paper in the typewriter, or you turn on the computer and bring up the right file, and then you stare at it for an hour or so. You begin rocking, just a little at first, and then like a huge autistic child. You look at the ceiling, and over at the clock, yawn, and stare at the paper again. Then, with your fingers poised on the keyboard, you squint at an image that is forming in your mind -- a scene, a locale, a character, whatever -- and you try to quiet your mind so you can hear what that landscape or character has to say above the other voices in your mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to make God laugh, tell her your plans.</li>\n<li>The problem is acceptance, which is something we're taught not to do. We're taught to improve uncomfortable situations, to change things, alleviate unpleasant feelings. But if you accept the reality that you have been given- that you are not in a productive creative period- you free yourself to begin filling up again.</li>\n<li>Don't look at your feet to see if you are doing it right. Just dance.</li>\n<li>We all know we're going to die; what's important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this.</li>\n<li>My gratitude for good writing is unbounded; I’m grateful for it the way I’m grateful for the ocean.</li>\n<li>I don't think you have time to waste not writing because you are afraid you won't be good at it.</li>\n<li>You get your intuition back when you make space for it, when you stop the chattering of the rational mind. The rational mind doesn't nourish you. You assume that it gives you the truth, because the rational mind is the golden calf that this culture worships, but this is not true. Rationality squeezes out much that is rich and juicy and fascinating.</li>\n<li>If you are a writer, or want to be a writer, this is how you spend your days--listening, observing, storing things away, making your isolation pay off. You take home all you've taken in, all that you've overheard, and you turn it into gold. (Or at least you try.)</li>\n<li>The society to which we belong seems to be dying or is already dead. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but clearly the dark side is rising. Things could not have been more odd and frightening in the Middle Ages. But the tradition of artists will continue no matter what form the society takes. And this is another reason to write: people need us, to mirror for them and for each other without distortion-not to look around and say, 'Look at yourselves, you idiots!,' but to say, 'This is who we are.”</li>\n<li>Having a baby is like suddenly getting the world's worst roommate.</li>\n<li>I used to think that paired opposites were a given, that love was the opposite of hate, right the opposite of wrong. But now I think we sometimes buy into these concepts because it is so much easier to embrace absolutes than to suffer reality. I don't think anything is the opposite of love. Reality is unforgivingly complex.</li>\n<li>If your wife locks you out of the house, you don't have a problem with your door.</li>\n<li>The garden is one of the two great metaphors for humanity. The garden is about life and beauty and the impermanence of all living things. The garden is about feeding your children, providing food for the tribe. It’s part of an urgent territorial drive that we can probably trace back to animals storing food. It’s a competitive display mechanism, like having a prize bull, this greed for the best tomatoes and English tea roses. It’s about winning; about providing society with superior things; and about proving that you have taste, and good values, and you work hard. And what a wonderful relief, every so often, to know who the enemy is. Because in the garden, the enemy is everything: the aphids, the weather, time. And so you pour yourself into it, care so much, and see up close so much birth, and growth, and beauty, and danger, and triumph. And then everything dies anyway, right? But you just keep doing it.</li>\n<li>Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then unhypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly.</li>\n<li>We write to expose the unexposed. If there is one door in the castle you have been told not to go through, you must. Otherwise, you'll just be rearranging furniture in rooms you've already been in.</li>\n<li>Try to write in a directly emotional way, instead of being too subtle or oblique. Don't be afraid of your material or your past. Be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you. Be afraid of not getting your writing done.</li>\n<li>This is what separates artists from ordinary people: the belief, deep in our hearts, that if we build our castles well enough, somehow the ocean won't wash them away. I think this is a wonderful kind of person to be.</li>\n<li>One thing I know for sure about raising children is that every single day a kid needs discipline.... But also every single day a kid needs a break.</li>\n<li>Some people wanted to get rich or famous, but my friends and I wanted to get real. We wanted to get deep.</li>\n<li>I took notes on the people around me, in my town, in my family, in my memory. I took notes on my own state of mind, my grandiosity, the low self-esteem. I wrote down the funny stuff I overheard. I learned to be like a ship's rat, veined ears trembling, and I learned to scribble it all down.</li>\n<li>When people shine a little light on their monster, we find out how similar most of our monsters are.</li>\n<li>and you try to quiet your mind so you can hear...</li>\n<li>Being a writer guarantees that you will spend too much time alone -- and that as a result, your mind will begin to warp.</li>\n<li>Plot grows out of character. If you focus on who the people in your story are, if you sit and write about two people you are getting to know better every day, something is bound to happen.</li>\n<li>If you are writing the clearest, truest words you can find and doing the best you can to understand and communicate, this will shine on paper like its own little lighthouse. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining.</li>\n<li>A writer paradoxically seeks the truth and tells lies every step of the way.</li>\n<li>If you’re not enough before the gold medal, you won’t be enough with it.</li>\n<li>I am learning slowly to bring my crazy pinball-machine mind back to this place.</li>\n<li>But it is fantasy to think that successful writers do not have these bored, defeated hours, these hours of deep insecurity when one feels as small and jumpy as a water bug. They do. But they also often feel a great sense of amazement that they get to write, and they know that this is what they want to do for the rest of their lives.</li>\n<li>The way I dance is by writing.</li>\n<li>Writing can be a pretty desperate endeavor, because it is about some of our deepest needs: our need to be visible, to be heard, our need to make sense of our lives, to wake up and grow and belong. It is no wonder if we sometimes tend to take ourselves perhaps a bit too seriously.</li>\n<li>Throughout my childhood I believed that what I thought about was different from what other kids thought about. It was not necessarily more profound, but there was a struggle going on inside me to find some sort of creative or spiritual or aesthetic way of seeing the world and organizing it in my head.</li>\n<li>You begin to string words together like beads to tell a story. You are desperate to communicate, to edify or entertain, to preserve moments of grace or joy or transcendence, to make real or imagined events come alive. But you cannot will this to happen. It is a matter of persistence and faith and hard work. So you might as well just go ahead and get started.</li>\n<li>Anyone who survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life.</li>\n<li>If you don’t believe in what you are saying, there is no point in your saying it. You might as well call it a day and go bowling.</li>\n<li>In this dark and wounded society, writing can give you the pleasures of the woodpecker, of hollowing out a hole in a tree where you can build your nest and say, “This is my niche, this is where I live now, this is where I belong.</li>\n<li>I tell my students that the odds of their getting published and of it bringing them financial security, peace of mind, and even joy are probably not that great. Ruin, hysteria, bad skin, unsightly tics, ugly financial problems, maybe; but probably not peace of mind. I tell them that I think they ought to write anyway.</li>\n<li>If you want to know how God feels about money, look at whom she gives it to.</li>\n<li>I read more than other kids; I luxuriated in books. Books were my refuge.</li>\n<li>I told myself that historically when people do too well too quickly, they are a Greek tragedy waiting to happen.</li>\n<li>Good dialogue encompasses both what is said and what is not said.</li>\n<li>You can’t stop the raging storm, but singing can change the hearts and spirits of the people who are together on that ship.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bird By Bird | Some Instructions On Writing And Life by Anne Lamott","date":"November 05, 2022","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/elements-of-style/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E.B.
